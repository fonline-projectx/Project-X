{100}{}{Caravan Packer}
{200}{}{You see Caravan packer.}
{210}{}{He looks pretty busy with the caravans.}
{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{Got the unloading job.}
{1020}{}{We are talking the first time.}
{1030}{}{We talked already.}
{2000}{}{What now? I am busy.}
{2010}{}{Do you have some job for me?}
{2020}{}{Do you have some job for me?}
{2030}{}{I'm just looking around, thanks.}
{2040}{}{So am I, you filth!}
{3000}{}{Don't you see that I am busy?}
{3010}{}{Do you have some job for me?}
{3020}{}{I'm just looking around, thanks and bye.}
{4000}{}{Yes, well, I'd like you to help me unload some boxes from the caravan cart. Think you could take 10 boxes and drop them where the others are?}
{4010}{}{Sure, I'll do it.}
{4020}{}{No way, you loser!}
{5000}{}{Are you done with the work?}
{5010}{}{Yes, finished the last box right now.}
{5020}{}{Not yet.}
{6000}{}{Good, here is your reward, 250 caps, don't you go spend it all on Iguana. I have more work for you later if you're still in need of some cash.}
{6010}{}{Thanks.}
{7000}{}{Then hurry up. I don't have the whole day.}
{7010}{}{Yeah, yeah...}
{8000}{}{Not now, come back later.}
{8010}{}{Okay.}
