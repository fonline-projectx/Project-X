{3000}{}{What's up, man?}
{3010}{}{Taking it easy.}
{3020}{}{Yeah not a lot. You playing cards there?}
{4000}{}{Yeah, keep at it.}
{4010}{}{Yeah will do. What are you playing?}
{5000}{}{Why you asking, man? You a card player?}
{5010}{}{Not really. I was just asking, you know.}
{5020}{}{I dabble.}
{5030}{}{Hell yes I am. But I haven't found a decent table in weeks.}
{6000}{}{"I dabble." Hahaha, sheeeeeit. You're a fruity motherfucker, man.}
{6010}{}{Hey man, I'm just saying. I play a bit but not a lot. Just saying.}
{6020}{}{Call me a fruity motherfucker? That shit is not on. You're dead, fuckles. [Kick his ass.]}
{7000}{}{Alright, alright. We're playing poker, man. Hold'em. None of that lame-ass Tragic shit, and none of that whacky 'two on the table, one in your hand, three in the middle, another one in your hand, one more on the table' bullshit poker they play in Redding.}
{7010}{}{Right. [You have no idea what he's talking about. But it's probably about cards.]}
{8000}{}{You game for a bit? I can teach you a little if you want, nothing goin' on right now. I ain't going easy on you, but we'll do this run for no money, cause otherwise that's just damn cruel.}
{8010}{}{Alright, let's deal. [Play some cards.]}
{8020}{}{No way, brother. Cards are for poofs. I'm outta here.}
{9000}{}{Yeah you getting the hang of it huh? You're not that bad, man. See how it goes now? Maybe you can play a little with your friends and make some pocket money.}
{9010}{}{Thanks. [You learnt some card skills. You've got a better eye for odds than you did a minute ago.]}
{10000}{}{Yo, back again?}
{10010}{}{Oh yes. I'm here to beat your ass at cards and all that.}
{10020}{}{Correct. Time to play some cards.}
{10030}{}{Back to kick the shit out of you, via the medium of playing cards.}
{11000}{}{Oh-ho, not getting cocky I hope! Haha, I'm just messing with ya. Yo Murphy, perk up, we got a game.}
{11010}{}{[Sit down and look like you mean business.]}
{12000}{}{Damn man, guess I taught you too good. [He laughs.] Nah man, all's fair at the table, we don't have the energy to start fights over this shit. Your winning's are yours, fair an' square. Just glad you didn't clean us out.}
{12010}{}{[Pocket your winnings and swagger off.]}
{13000}{}{Yeah man tell me about it! Every game you walk in to in the city there's either a magnum under the table or half a dozen shills on it. That's why we just play back here.}
{13010}{}{Yeah, I guess a bunch of kidnapping, slave-trading murderers throw down the most refined card-game, huh.}
{14000}{}{Look, any one of these motherfuckers might fuck me over one day, we all know it and we all live with it. But man, there really ain't a whole lot of shit to do in a fucking cave, you know? One of these clowns fucks someone else over a card game, enjoy reading the Lavender Flower each night in your own fuckin' corner. Until you get shanked in your fucking bed, right?}
{14010}{}{I guess you've got a point.}
{15000}{}{Boredom's enough to keep even bad ass motherfuckers like us in line. I mean sure, we go to the Den and play a game, wont think twice about dropping a couple of suckers to take off with the pot, but here, man, shit is run right. It's beautiful.}
{15010}{}{Sure.}
{15020}{}{Sounds it.}
{15030}{}{I guess.}
{16000}{}{Anyway, enough talking, right? Want a little game?}
{16010}{}{Well fuck yes I do.}
{16020}{}{I'm not here to listen to your gay-ass life story, I'm here to kick your asses at cards. Gay-ass cards.}
{16030}{}{Of course.}
{16040}{}{Yes please.}
{17000}{}{Alright, 's what I like to hear. Yo Murphy, Rodriguez. Yo hey King! Got a game here, man.}
{17010}{}{[Play cards with the Khans.]}
{18000}{}{You run a nice game my friend. I mean King's a dumb motherfucker, no offence, so no surprises when he ate your bluff, but Murphy's a straight ice queen at the table and you made off with more of her chips than she'll admit tomorrow. [He laughs loudly.] Alright, enjoy that shit. Take it easy.}
{18010}{}{Will do. [Pocket your winnings and leave like a champion, a little wiser and a little richer.]}
