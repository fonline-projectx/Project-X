{100}{}{Junkyard Todd}
{200}{}{You see a smuddly looking man.}
{210}{}{You see Junkyard Todd. He lives alone here since many years.}
{1000}{}{Preddialogue settings}
{1010}{}{2}
{2000}{}{Hey. Who's there? I am Todd. What do you want? You know, just tell me. }
{2010}{}{I have the fuel controller for you.}
{2020}{}{I've got another fuel controller for you.}
{2030}{}{This looks like a great place with much junk. Can you build me a car?}
{2040}{}{Hey, I want to sell my car. Are you interested in this wreck?}
{2050}{}{Do you offer any other services?}
{2060}{}{I'll just be going now.}
{3000}{}{Yeah. I mean. You don't have the caps. You know, I can't give it to you then. Sorry.}
{3010}{}{What shit is that? Okay, I come back when I actually have the caps...}
{4000}{}{My garage is a little full right now, you know. Come back when we got a little more room. That would be pretty cool.}
{5000}{}{(He throws you the keys) She's waiting for you in the garage. You want it repaired or modified, you come back to us, y'hear?}
{5010}{}{Thanks, Todd. Bye.}
{6000}{}{(He throws you the keys) She's waiting for you in the garage. You want it repaired or modified, you come back to us, y'hear?}
{6010}{}{Thanks, Todd. Bye.}
{7000}{}{Dunno. I mean. Yeah. Maybe. Let me see it... [He is checking out your wreck.] ...Yeah. I mean. It's cool and I'll take it. For @lex sell_cost@. Deal?}
{7010}{}{Sounds good to me.}
{7020}{}{Not today. I'll hang onto it for now.}
{8000}{}{You know. I think you've made a great deal here. [He takes the key from you.]}
{8010}{}{Maybe. See you.}
{9000}{}{Do I look like a repair station or what?}
{9010}{}{Uhm. Yeah, somehow.}
{9020}{}{I was just curious. I wanted something else.}
{10000}{}{Yeah. I mean. You don't have the caps. You know, I can't give it to you then. Sorry.}
{10010}{}{What shit is that. Okay, I come back when I actually have the caps...}
{11000}{}{You know. I think you don't have a car here. Now I can't buy it from you, yeah? See. Come back when you got a car.}
{12000}{}{Hey, eh. Yeah. You know, I have stuff to do in the moment.}
{13000}{}{You know. It would be cool if you could show me the car key. Let me see it. Yeah?}
{14000}{}{Where is your car? You know. I can't see it.}
{15000}{}{You know. It would be cool if you could show me the car key. Let me see it. Yeah?}
{16000}{}{Yeah. Maybe. I mean. You know, I can build you something. But, you know. You have to do something for it first.}
{16010}{}{What is it then?}
{17000}{}{If you can bring me a fuel controller, I can build a pretty car for you. You know. This will be cool. But you have to give me some money then too. }
{17010}{}{Sure thing. I will be back with such a fuel controller. Guess I will stumble across one sooner or later. Bye.}
{17020}{}{Do I look bored? You can search it by yourself.@@I changed my mind. Don't want this anymore.@@Ok, you can do it alone.@@Meh, I have other business to do in the moment.}
{18000}{}{Well. You know, I can't build you a car then.}
{18010}{}{I changed my mind again. What is it again, that you need to have?}
{18020}{}{Bye.}
{19000}{}{You know, that's pretty cool! Give it to me. Also give me the money... That's @lex cockroach@ caps and I'll assemble the car.}
{19010}{}{That's cool. Here are the caps and the fuel controller...}
{19020}{}{I gotta get some more caps. I'll be back.}
{19030}{}{Do you have anything special?}
{19040}{}{Meh. No, maybe next time.}
{20000}{}{Your choice, you know.}
{20010}{}{Yes, I know. Bye.}
{21000}{}{Hmm.. now that you are asking about it, I can put that fuel controller into one of these wrecks: Police car for @lex policecar@ caps, Motorcycle for @lex motorcycle@ caps, Firetruck for @lex firetruck@ caps, Truck for @lex truck@ caps. Are you interested?}
{21010}{}{Yeah, fix Police Car for me.}
{21020}{}{I'll take that Motorcycle.}
{21030}{}{Firetruck suits me, get it running!}
{21040}{}{A truck is all I need now.}
{21050}{}{Nevermind.}
