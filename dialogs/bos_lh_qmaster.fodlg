{3010}{}{Sir! I'm back from the Necropolis bunker!}
{4000}{}{Ah, I was wandering who went down there, heard it was some new blood taking names and earning stripes. It's good to see that men and women like you. Ehem. What do you have to report? And whats the personel status?}

{5000}{}{Goddamn it! I never believed the stories about that place.. Well maybe they are true after all.. I'm going to see how soon we'll have that place reinforced. I want you to keep your mouth shut about what happened there, am I making myself clear?}
