{2000}{}{Hello there, my name’s Lenny. H’how can I h’help you?}
{2010}{}{What do you do here?}
{2020}{}{I’m wounded. Can you help me?}
{2030}{}{I’m just looking around. Goodbye.}
{3000}{}{How c’can I help you?}
{3010}{}{What do you do here?}
{3020}{}{I’m wounded. Can you help me?}
{3030}{}{I’m just looking around. Goodbye.}
{4000}{}{Y’you sh’should go home.@@I c’can’t take time for you.@@Sh’shoo. Go away!}
{5000}{}{W’well, I h’help H’harold mostly. Wh’when people get hurt, I h’help them out.}
{5010}{}{Help Harold do what?}
{5020}{}{You can heal people?}
{5030}{}{I’m wounded. Can you help me?}
{5040}{}{I’ll have to keep that in mind, if I get hurt. Thanks. Goodbye.}
{6000}{}{L’let me t’take a look at that. I th’think I c’can help you. I c'can h'help you. B'but it'll c'cost you $@lex price@. F'for supplies.}
{6010}{}{Well... all right. That sounds fair.}
{6020}{}{I don't think I need your help right now. Goodbye.}
{7000}{}{Well, b’before the W’war I w’was a doctor.}
{7010}{}{Before the war? But that must have been almost 160 years ago.}
{7020}{}{Oh; well, that explains it. Thanks. Goodbye.}
{8000}{}{That's t’true. B’but the radiation seems to have g’given us g’ghouls a longer life-span. ‘Course, it took almost eveything else away.}
{8010}{}{Took things away?}
{8020}{}{Everything seems to have good and bad mixed together. Goodbye.}
{9000}{}{W’well, y’yes. We look l’like f’friggin’ f’freaks. We d’don’t have any skin, for Chrisakes.}
{9010}{}{Well, I guess you have seen better days.}
{9020}{}{As a group, you’re not the most attractive bunch on the planet. Goodbye.}
{10000}{}{Y’you c’could say that. I’d trade in all those years to b’be a ’normal person again.}
{10010}{}{Well, not much hope of that, I suppose.}
{10020}{}{I bet you would. Goodbye.}
{11000}{}{If those f’fools in Vault City w’would share their medical technology, I’m sure we could c’cleanse the excess r’radiation and heal ourselves.}
{11010}{}{They won’t help you?}
{11020}{}{I think I’ve heard enough. Goodbye.}
{12000}{}{Y’you’ve been to Vault City? Then you t’tell me wh’what you think the chances of g'getting h’help from those bigots is. M’might as well watch a p’paper dog chase an asbestos c’cat through hell.}
{12010}{}{I’m sorry to hear that, but I think you’re right. Let me ask you about something else.}
{12020}{}{I’m sorry to hear that. Goodbye.}
{13000}{}{I c’can fix you up. H'hold still.}
{13010}{}{Thanks Lenny. Goodbye.}
