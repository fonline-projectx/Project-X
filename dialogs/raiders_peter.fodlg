{100}{}{Peter}
{200}{}{You see Peter.}
{210}{}{You see a young wastelander standing around, watching what's going on intently.}
{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{Attack if you bother him}
{1020}{}{Hostile to good people}
{1030}{}{First.}
{1040}{}{Second.}
{2000}{}{[He looks at you as you approach; his eyebrows raising almost imperceptibly, questioning you.]}
{2010}{}{Who are you?}
{2020}{}{Hello.}
{2030}{}{[Shrug at him and walk on.]}
{3000}{}{Who are you?}
{3010}{}{@pname@. Who are you?}
{3020}{}{Not telling.}
{4000}{}{I'm Peter.}
{4010}{}{What do you do here, Peter?}
{4020}{}{What do you do here, Peter?}
{5000}{}{A little bit of everything. I help out at the bar at night, help out Art during the day, pitch in with whatever needs doing.}
{5010}{}{Are you a Khan?}
{6000}{}{Nope. It's not for me.}
{6010}{}{Why do you live here then?}
{6020}{}{Why do you live here then?}
{7000}{}{It works well for me. I like the atmosphere, and they can use a guy who doesn't ask questions.}
{7010}{}{What can you tell me about the Khans?}
{7020}{}{What can you tell me about the Khans?}
{8000}{}{You sure got a lot of questions, stranger.}
{8010}{}{[End]}
{9000}{}{I'm sure you've heard stories.}
{9010}{}{Yeah, but I can't help but notice I'm not being shot to death right now.}
{10000}{}{If someone who didn't belong showed up, they would be. You don't have to be a Khan to hang out outside, but you can't be a goody-two-shoes.}
{10010}{}{So normal people can live outside?}
{11000}{}{Yeah, inside is Khans only, but outside they let a few of us regular wastelanders stay. It works well for them - they get extra guns if they ever get attacked, and having a few shacks out here has got them a trader, a bar and...well, you can see for yourself.}
{11010}{}{Yes I can. Thanks for the information.}
{12000}{}{Hi @pname@.@@How's it goin'?}
{13000}{}{What the fuck are ya doin' here, man? Get lost before someone shoots ya!@@We don't like your kind here. You better get the fuck outta here, before getting bullet in the back.@@Man, I would dissapear from this place if I were you.}
{14000}{}{That's it man, you're history!}
