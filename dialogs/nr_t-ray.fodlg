{100}{}{T-Ray}
{200}{}{You see a good-looking black man...er, no, wait. You see T-Ray.}
{210}{}{You see a heavily muscled black man with thick glasses, a light beard, and an attitude.}
{210}{}{You see T-Ray. He looks pretty good in them jeans.}
{210}{}{You see T-Ray. He occasionally flexes and feels his biceps, whispering "damn" to himself.}
{210}{}{You can barely make out T-Ray past all that attitude.}
{1000}{}{Preddialogue settings}
{1010}{}{2}
{2000}{}{Hey, what can T-Ray do for you? We're in the business of buyin', sellin', repairin' and modifyin' all kinds of vehicles.}
{2010}{}{Vehicles, huh? What do you have in stock?}
{2020}{}{I want to sell my car. You interested?}
{2030}{}{Do you offer any other services?}
{2040}{}{I need a copy of this key, T-Ray.}
{2050}{}{That's not what I'm here for. You interested in some of this? (Show him case)}
{2060}{}{I haven't met such tough bargainer since -- well, ever! How do you get to be that good at arranging prices and attracting costumers? [Negotiator]}
{2070}{}{I'll just be going now.}
{3000}{}{Let's see now. We got hummers for @lex hummer@, buggies goin' for @lex buggy@, scouts for @lex scout@. If you're feeling classy, we'll sell you a Highwayman for @lex highwayman@. And if it's still not enough for you, we've got Corvega for sale - that's only @lex corvega@.}
{3010}{}{Give me a hummer.}
{3020}{}{I'll take a buggy.}
{3030}{}{A scout sounds good.}
{3040}{}{I've got the chips, give me the Highwayman.}
{3050}{}{Nothing less than Corvega will suit my needs.}
{3060}{}{Nope, nothing for me there. But maybe you could do something else for me?}
{3070}{}{Good selection, but I gotta go now.}
{4000}{}{No money, no car, pal. Get yourself some serious chips, and we can do bitness.}
{5000}{}{Our garage is a little full right now. Come back when we got a little more room.}
{6000}{}{(He throws you the keys) She's waiting for you in the garage. You want it repaired or modified, you come back to us, y'hear?}
{6010}{}{Thanks, T-Ray. Bye.}
{7000}{}{(He throws you the keys) She's waiting for you in the garage. You want it repaired or modified, you come back to us, y'hear?}
{7010}{}{Thanks, T-Ray. Bye.}
{8000}{}{Hmm, doesn't look too impressive. Uses too much 'tricity, smells *sniff* somethin' died in here, trunk's too smallï¿½ I guess I could scrap her and use her for parts. I'll give you @lex sell_cost@ for it.}
{8010}{}{Fine, deal.}
{8020}{}{Not today. I'll hang onto it for now.}
{9000}{}{Excellent. Hey boys, take care of this one! (He throws the keys out to the garage)}
{10000}{}{We can refuel, repair, and do a little tinkerin' with the engine. Make it run on alcohol as well as energy cells. Save a lot of cash on runnin' costs.}
{10010}{}{Just fill 'er up.}
{10020}{}{I guess it could use a few repairs. Would you take a look?}
{10030}{}{Running on alcohol, huh? Sounds like exactly what I need.}
{10040}{}{I was just curious. I wanted something else.}
{11000}{}{Sounds good. It'll cost you @lex fuel_cost@.}
{11010}{}{Alright, fine, just do it already.}
{11020}{}{I ain't got the cash, sorry.}
{11030}{}{Forget it, some other time.}
{12000}{}{Well, considering the extent of the damages, we could fix her up for @lex wear_cost@ chips.}
{12010}{}{Deal. Just fix the damn thing.}
{12020}{}{A little rich for my blood.}
{12030}{}{Some other time, thanks.}
{13000}{}{Well, this is no minor undertaking. Something this extensive will cost you @lex bio_cost@ chips, aiight?}
{13010}{}{No problem, just get started.}
{13020}{}{Uh, I think I left my cash in the trunk.}
{13030}{}{Changed my mind. I want something else.}
{14000}{}{You ain't got the chips, we ain't doing bitness.@@If you ain't got the chips, then you ain't got no business here. I got better things to do than be talking to your cheap ass.@@What, do you think cars are CHEAP?!@@Cut the bull-shit! Get some money, or get out.}
{15000}{}{Your don't need these particular amen-ities, aiight?}
{16000}{}{All set. Take her easy, now.}
{17000}{}{Aiight, this ain't my normal bitness though, y'hear? You get any wheels, you drop by.}
{18000}{}{Sorry brutha, I got shit to do right now. Come back later.}
{19000}{}{Now how the hell am I supposed to know which vee-hic-cle you're talkin' 'bout? Show me a key, aiight?}
{20000}{}{Then where the hell's your car? If it ain't in the garage, I ain't touchin' it. I don't do house calls.}
{21000}{}{Now how the hell am I supposed to know which vee-hic-cle you're talkin' 'bout? Show me a key, aiight?}
{22000}{}{Boys, who let the simpleton in here?}
{23000}{}{Do I look like a dope fiend to you? Or maybe you think this is some sort of fuckin' drugstore? Now get yo' silly ass out of here before I call se-cu-ri-tee.}
{23010}{}{I think you misunderstood my offer. I deal with the best. This is the purest stock you can find. With this you could get some extra pocket money on the side.}
{23020}{}{I think you misunderstood my offer. I deal with the best. This is the purest stock you can find. With this you could get some extra pocket money on the side.}
{23030}{}{I've changed my mind. I gotta go.}
{24000}{}{Extra pocket money... You might be right on this one. But this shit better be good or you'll regret messing with T-Ray.}
{24010}{}{You won't regret it. So how about...}
{24020}{}{I've changed my mind. I gotta go.}
{25000}{}{Keep talkin'.}
{25010}{}{How about 100 vials for you and your boys?}
{26000}{}{Oh I don't think so. Now quit wasting my time.}
{26010}{}{Nobody talks to me like that and lives!}
{26020}{}{I'm on my way.}
{27000}{}{I'm puttin' led in your mothafuckin' ass}
{27010}{}{Try me!}
{27020}{}{Yikes!}
{27030}{}{I'm sorry. I was just...}
{28000}{}{I like that.}
{28010}{}{Sounds good.}
{28020}{}{I've changed my mind. I gotta go.}
{29000}{}{(Transaction took place) @@ (You came to an agreement)}
{29010}{}{[END]}
{30000}{}{No car's gonna make that fucked-up excuse for a face cool. Why even bother?}
{31000}{}{Hey dude, you're talking to T-Ray. I learned ma school on da street, got it? When I was a boy... [You listen for a while]}
{31010}{}{Quite a story, T-Ray, that one. Look, I also wanted to ask you about something else...}
{31020}{}{Yeah, right. I gotta go.}
