{100}{}{Conductor}
{200}{}{You see the conductor.}
{210}{}{He looks a bit fuzzy.}
{220}{}{You see the knocked out conductor.}
{230}{}{The train can't continue, as long as he is knocked out!}
{240}{}{You see the dead conductor.}
{250}{}{Without him, the train can't continue!}
{260}{}{You see the dead conductor.}
{270}{}{Without him, the train can't continue!}
{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{Train goes on!}
{1020}{}{All fine, dude.}
{1030}{}{Answer text}
{2000}{}{Yes, yes, is it over? Is it over, are they gone?}
{2010}{}{Not yet, stay down.}
{2020}{}{What happened?}
{2030}{}{Everything okay, we killed them.}
{2040}{}{Everything okay, we scared them away.}
{2050}{}{Everything okay, we paid 'em some money.}
{2060}{}{Everything okay, we talked them over.}
{3000}{}{The rails are clean? We can't continue until the path isn't blocked anymore.}
{3010}{}{Not yet, still working on it.}
{3020}{}{The path is clear, we can continue. *DEV NOTE: Needs demand IS PATH CLEAN?*}
{4000}{}{By god, these raiders become more and more dangerous! President Tandi should finally take a more drastic measures and wipe out all the scum that's running around! What good is this republic for, if they can't even keep their borders clean...}
{4010}{}{Is the train damaged? Can we continue with our little journey?}
{4020}{}{You don't seem to like the NCR a lot.}
{4030}{}{Yeah, someone should. See you later.}
{5000}{}{The train is fine, good piece of metal, can't get seriously damaged that fast. We can continue, as soon as the rails aren't blocked anymore. But look at me, I can't even pick up a small one of these stones! ... [He tries to lift up a stone, but fails miserably] ... *urgh* ... You have to help me, else we will never get away from here. Not with the train at least.}
{5010}{}{I'll see what can be done about it.}
{5020}{}{Guess I am faster on foot then... See you...}
{6000}{}{We can't continue as long as the path is blocked.}
{7000}{}{Nah ... [He nods in a slightly disagreeing way] ... It's not the NCR in itself, it's just because no shit happens no more. In the beginning, I tell you, our troops marched out and cleaned one scumbag-hole and another and another! ... Nowdays they are too concentrated on getting new territory ... Bullshit, I say. }
{7010}{}{Is the train damaged? Can we continue with our little journey?}
{7020}{}{Well, then. See you later.}
{8000}{}{Get into the wagons, we continue!}
{8010}{}{Fine. *DEV NOTE: Teleport player into train*}
{8020}{}{Soon, have to do something else first.}
{9000}{}{Hurry up, we don't wait.}
{10000}{}{Ooohhhh, by god!}
{11000}{}{The rails are blocked with a rubble pile. I had to stop the train or we would have been derailed! Then these rail raider thugs showed up...}
{11010}{}{I'll see what can be done.}
