{100}{}{Hub Farmer}
{200}{}{You see a farmer.}
{240}{}{You see a dead farmer.}
{260}{}{You see a slain farmer.}
{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{job running}
{1020}{}{job done}
{1030}{}{never took a job before}
{1040}{}{there is a job again.}
{1050}{}{no job right now.}
{2000}{}{Hey, you! [He waves you over.] Yes, you! Do you want a job? I need someone to bring water to the workers on the fields. I'll give you 100 hubbucks.}
{2010}{}{What am I supposed to do?}
{2020}{}{What are the Water Merchants saying about your water service?}
{2030}{}{Not interested. Bye.}
{3000}{}{That's easy: You'll get yourself a waterbag, fill it with water on the waterpipe here [He points to his left.] and bring it to the workers on the east, and the west sides fields.}
{3010}{}{I am on my way.}
{3020}{}{From where do I get waterbags?}
{3030}{}{Nah, not now. }
{4000}{}{Good! Come back to me, after you have given out the water to at least 10 farmers.}
{4010}{}{[End]}
{5000}{}{Come back when you are done with the job.}
{6000}{}{Are you done with the job?}
{6010}{}{All done.}
{7000}{}{Good! Here is your money, 150 hubbucks. Come back later, if you want to work for me again.}
{8000}{}{Sorry, but I don't have any jobs for you in the moment. Check back later.}
{8010}{}{What are the Water Merchants saying about your water service?}
{8020}{}{Maybe.}
{9000}{}{Do you want to work for me again? I need someone to bring water to the workers on the fields. Like the last time, I'll give you 100 hubbucks.}
{9010}{}{Sure, I'll do that.}
{9020}{}{What are the Water Merchants saying about your water service?}
{9030}{}{Maybe later. Unfortunately, I am really out of time right now.}
{10000}{}{Good! Get yourself a waterbag, fill it with water on the waterpipe here [He points to his left.] and bring it to the workers on the east side and west side fields.}
{10010}{}{I am on my way.}
{10020}{}{From where do I get waterbags again?}
{11000}{}{Check the local traders. Shouldn't be too hard to get some. Maybe Mitch in his general store is your best chance.}
{11010}{}{I am on my way.}
{11020}{}{Maybe I do it later. Bye.}
{12000}{}{We have a deal, like many other people in and around the Hub. Paying taxes on the given out water per gallon. It's bad and bleeds me - and everyone else - dry, but that's the way it goes, the Water Merchants are the caravan company with the biggest influence overall. }
{12010}{}{Is your contract that bad? Maybe I could try to talk to the Water Merchants for something better.}
{12020}{}{If you want to, I could try to talk to the Water Merchants.}
{12030}{}{That's really bad. Anyway, see you later.}
{13000}{}{It wouldn't change a damn anyway. Don't run around and yell bullshit in my name, it would hurt me more than it does already now! }
{13010}{}{See you later.}
{14000}{}{[He looks thoughtful.] Fine, I'll let you do this. But damn, you'll be sorry, if you make it any worse than it already is!}
{14010}{}{See you later.}
