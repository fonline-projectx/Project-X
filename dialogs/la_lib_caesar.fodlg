Hammilton is officially a Follower of the Apocalypse, but belongs to Caesar's Legion. Caesar itself is moved away already, while Hammilton still takes his role as Follower to get more informations from this territory.

The "Who are you really"-question pops up after the player has done the train quest. He gets a hint on this from the target person.

{8010}{}{Can I ask you some question?}
{9000}{}{No. And now get out here, I have to work.}
{9010}{}{Maybe I can help you with your problem}
{9020}{}{Good, bye.}
{10000}{}{Mhm. [He takes a look at you closely.] Are you good? Do you know how to use a gun? Can you be a ice cold motherfucker?}
{10010}{}{Guns? God no! That's really not what I am looking for. }
{10020}{}{I think I am pretty skilled.}
{10030}{}{The gun is my longer arm. I can't without it.}
{10040}{}{I *am* a ice cold motherfucker!}
{11000}{}{Then I don't need you. And now get out here, I have to work.}
{11010}{}{Wait! Did I said no guns? Well, I meaned... No guns for the other! Tell me what I should do and I am on it.}
{11020}{}{Yeah. Bye.}
{12000}{}{This could work. Anyway... I need a god damn motherfucker and I give you the job. But don't prove me that you are *not* a god damn motherfucker or shit comes down on you. }
{12010}{}{Tell me what's the job about.}
{13000}{}{I have some very explicit business ongoing and some days ago, one of my... workers... has left.}
{13010}{}{So whats the job now?}
{13020}{}{I have to bring him back?}
{13030}{}{What do you want me to do exactly?}
{14000}{}{Find him. Find him and then kill him. Report back to me, as soon as you are done.}
{14010}{}{Good. Do you have any clue where I can find him?}
{14020}{}{That's horrible. Not with me! Bye.}
{15000}{}{If it would be me, I would try to take the train and flee as far away as possible. You should try it there first. Talk to everyone, maybe someone saw him. He is a middle-aged man, black hair, normal build, wears a old leather armor with a black bull on it.}
{15010}{}{What train are you talking about?}
{16000}{}{Are you sleeping or what? The NCR train that is running since some time now. They fixed up the rail lines.}
{16010}{}{Never heard of that.}
{16020}{}{Where can I find the train station?}
{17000}{}{The closest is in the north west from here. You have to travel a bit, but shouldn't take much time.}
{17010}{}{Fine. I will find your worker and get the job done.}
{18000}{}{Good. Come back to me and when you are done.}
{18010}{}{I will. [Leave]}
{18020}{}{Another question, before I start, if you don't mind.}
{19000}{}{It took them a long time and they are still working on rebuilding even more rail lines.}
{19010}{}{Where can I find the train station?}
{20000}{}{This is the library of the Follower of the Apocalypse. We study and archive all books we can find and which we choose to be very important for the future.}
{20010}{}{How can you guys survive out here?}
{20020}{}{I want to know something else.}
{20030}{}{That's all I wanted to hear. See you.}
{21000}{}{It's not as hard anymore, as it was few years ago. But why the fuck am I talking to you anyway? Get off, I am busy.}
{21010}{}{Wait, one last thing...}
{21020}{}{Okay.}
{22000}{}{You got damn idiot. You will regret it, I swear you. }
{23000}{}{You will regret what you have done.}
{24000}{}{Ladies and Gentleman, that's what I call good work!}
{24010}{}{You've searched a *god damn mother fucker* and that's what you got!}
{24020}{}{I think that it wasn't right.}
{24030}{}{I think that it wasn't right.}
{25000}{}{Something tells me, that you are not telling the truth. You are lying to me, am I right?}
{25010}{}{Your feelings must be wrong, because I've killed him and yes, this is the truth.}
{25020}{}{You are right, I didn't killed him. After I've heard his story, it was obvious to me that *you* are the person who should have been killed.}
{26000}{}{That's true! Man, what a great day now. }
{26010}{}{So, where is my reward? }
{26020}{}{So, where is my reward? }
{27000}{}{No. I know that you are lying to me. So, tell me. What have you done? The truth.}
{27010}{}{You are right, I didn't killed him. After I've heard his story, it was obvious to me that *you* are the person who should have been killed.}
{28000}{}{But it was your job and that's all that matters, *slaver*.}
{28010}{}{I'll guess. So... where is my reward now?}
{28020}{}{I'll guess. You can stab you my reward into your ass. Bye.}
{29000}{}{But it was your job and that's all that matters.}
{29010}{}{I'll guess. So... where is my reward now?}
{29020}{}{I'll guess. You can stab you my reward into your ass. Bye.}
