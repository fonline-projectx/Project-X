{200}{}{You see a scrawny old guy with a pen stuck behind his ear and spectacles balanced on the end of his nose.}
{210}{}{It's Vortis, the owner of this slave pen. He's got the tattoo, but it's faded.}
{210}{}{He's got about three teeth. His fingers and shirt are stained with blue ink. There's a really faded slaver's tattoo on his forehead.}

{2050}{}{I want to buy a slave.}
{2060}{}{I want to sell a slave.}
{2070}{}{Nothing. Wrong door.}
{3000}{}{This place is my place and I, Vortis, run an honest and legitimate busines no matter what anybody in NCR tells you. Since NCR doesn't allow slaves inside the gates, I mind them for folks who've got business inside.}
{3010}{}{One more question.}
{3020}{}{One more question.}

{8010}{}{Whatever.}
{9000}{}{Males, very well. I have some good slaves. The dumbest cost you @lex price0@ caps and the normals costs @lex price1@ caps What do you want? }
{9010}{}{I am searching for the dumbest you have. [You pay him @lex price0@ caps.]}
{9020}{}{"Normals"? You're a fucking charmer, Vortis. Well, guess I don't want a stupid one. I'll take a, uh 'Normal'. [You pay him @lex price1@ caps.]}

{11040}{}{Hm, my mistake, I don't have any.}

{12010}{}{Another question...}
{12020}{}{Another question...}
{12030}{}{Thanks, got to go.}

{13010}{}{Fine, fine. One more question.}
{13020}{}{Fine, fine. One more question.}
{13030}{}{Well if you're gonna get angry, I'm leaving.}
{14000}{}{Work? Not a chance. We got our hands full up here.}
{14010}{}{Too bad. Something else I was wondering.}
{14020}{}{Too bad. Something else I was wondering.}
{14030}{}{Alright, bye.}
{15000}{}{Thought you'd never ask. Right, here it basically works like the toilets in a bar. You pick 'boys' or 'girls'.}

{17010}{}{Got a real nice one.}
{17020}{}{How about this one? He's okay.}
{17030}{}{This one's not too smart, but I'm sure he could like, hold a door open for you or something.}
{17040}{}{I can't lie, this is some freak I picked up in the wastes. Might be worth a little bit, though?}
{17050}{}{Actually, I don't have one.}
{18000}{}{Alright, what women are you offering?}
{18010}{}{Get a load of this one, Vortis. Real piece of work.}
{18020}{}{What do you think of this one? Not bad, yeah?}
