{100}{}{Boyce}
{200}{}{You see Boyce.}
{210}{}{You see a guy whose laugh is better not heard.}
{220}{}{You see an unconcious man.}
{230}{}{It isn't like Boyce to be sleeping on the job, and he's bleeding from the forehead.}
{240}{}{He's dead, Jim.}
{250}{}{Boyce's short life has come to an end.}
{260}{}{You see pieces of Boyce.}
{270}{}{Boyce was never a comely man... but at least he was whole. Now, may he rest in pieces.}
{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{unknown}
{1020}{}{known}
{2000}{}{Yeah?}
{2010}{}{And you are?}
{2020}{}{Do you have spare machine parts for Thomas? He needs them in the power house.}
{2030}{}{Nothing.}
{3000}{}{What? Rumbling through the Junktown, popping up my place and ask stupid questions? Haven't you already heard for the Boyce, the former local used car dealer?}
{3010}{}{Actually, no. You were the car dealer once?}
{3020}{}{I think I heard enough. [Leave]}
{4000}{}{Just what the... Are you gonna repeat my words or ask something meaningful, redneck?}
{4010}{}{No, I mean, what are you doing now?}
{4020}{}{I better be back later.}
{5000}{}{That sounds like a question already. Well, I used to repair and sell cars before, but in the meantime everything useful that could be found around here is already scavenged and turned into cars. I can't sell anything more, except junk. Not that I really care, as long as I've gotta costumer, hehe.}
{5010}{}{So, you still repair things?}
{5020}{}{I see. Gotta go now, bye!}
{6000}{}{Yeah, right to the point. I can fix almost anything, but lately I've been doing only firearms. Brings a lot of caps, and there's always enough guns to repair, with all these thugs running through the town...}
{6010}{}{Hey, then you probably *are* the best person to talk about repairing antique stuff and salvaging all kind of junk.}
{6020}{}{That's exactly what I wanted to hear, because I had some questions about firearms...}
{6030}{}{Yes, that makes sense already. I have to go now, bye!}
{7000}{}{What is it now, rumbler?}
{7010}{}{I thought you must be the best person around here to talk about repairing antique stuff and salvaging all kind of junk.}
{7020}{}{I had some questions about firearms...}
{7030}{}{Do you have spare machine parts for Thomas? He needs them in the power house.}
{7040}{}{Wrong place. [Leave]}
{8000}{}{That took pretty long for him to ask for that... Told him before, he can have them. Anyway, here, get it. [After searching in a box, he throws a pair of clunky looking machine parts towards you.]}
{8010}{}{Wait, you don't want me to do anything for you?}
{8020}{}{Thanks and goodbye.}
{9000}{}{What? No. Why should I? You want to do something for me?}
{9010}{}{Uh, nevermind. Just wondered. See you around.}
{10000}{}{Like what?}
{10010}{}{I wanna learn how to make a gun... Nothing special, just the basics.}
{10020}{}{Say, maybe you could show me how to make some good guns? I'm willing to learn.}
{10030}{}{Erhm... Actually, nothing right now. I better be going.}
{11000}{}{Wanna blow off your fingers, huh? Okay, just don't say later I didn't warn you... I guess I can teach you something useful, but it has its price. Let's say $1500. For that price I can give you this magazine as well, Guns & Bullets. Might come in handy once in a while.}
{11010}{}{To hell with the money, I wanna learn it! [You give him $1500]}
{11020}{}{Damn, it's too much for me right now. But I'll be back later, be sure about it.}
{12000}{}{Well, ain'tcha the next wasteland's top gunsmith! I guess I could show you some more for a mere sum of 3000 caps. Whaddya say?}
{12010}{}{If the preaching justifies the price, then let's start with it, ol' man! [Give him $3000]}
{12020}{}{Damn, it's too much for me right now. But I'll be back later, be sure about it.}
{13000}{}{Now, now... Let's see what can be done with you. [Boyce takes to to the workbench and starts explaining]}
{13010}{}{Thanks for your time, Boyce. I think I'm gonna try it out by myself now.}
{14000}{}{You bet, @sex@|buddy||honey|! Anyway, what did you want to know?}
{14010}{}{You can repair even those things that went FUBAR long time ago. How's that? [Best of a Bad Lot]}
{14020}{}{How do you always get so much useful stuff from such a small heap of junk? [Dismantler]}
{14030}{}{Uhm... I think I have no specific questions for this occasion. Maybe later!}
{15000}{}{Look, if you were long enough in this business as I am, you'd know it yourself already. Now, all I usually do is... [Listen to Boyce and learn]}
{15010}{}{Thanks, I really needed that. Now, I was about to ask you something else...}
{15020}{}{Boyce, you're one big surprise! See you later, old chap!}
