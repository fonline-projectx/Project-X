{2000}{}{Hello and welcome to the Far Go Traders. How can I help you?}
{2010}{}{I'm looking for work.}
{2020}{}{I've got a message from J.D. to you.}
{2030}{}{What is it that you do here?}
{2040}{}{You can't. Bye.}
{3000}{}{We don't hire in the moment. Check back later.}
{3010}{}{Fine.}
{4000}{}{We trade wares between all the different settlements. Sounds simple? But it isn't.}
{4010}{}{I'm looking for work.}
{4020}{}{Have to go. Bye.}
{5000}{}{Yes? What is it? His caravan is too late already.}
{5010}{}{Well, that's actually the message. They are too late, and will show up here in like one or two days. A sand storm delayed the trip.}
{6000}{}{Damn, that's already the second time. Oh well... thank you for scouting. Here, I'll give you 'few Hubbucks.}
{6010}{}{Thanks. That's all what my job was about. See you.}
