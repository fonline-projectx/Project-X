{2000}{}{Hey there,}
{2010}{}{Who are you?}
{2020}{}{Nevermind.}
{3000}{}{Hey there, you look like someone who can take care of @sex@|himself||herself| looking for a job? Wanna ride with @lex caravan@?}
{3010}{}{Sure I am.}
{3020}{}{Who are you?}
{3030}{}{I don't think so.}
{4000}{}{Good. We're headed to @lex destination@ next and we're leaving at @lex time@. Your job will be protecting the caravan.}
{4010}{}{OK, I take the job.}
{4020}{}{OK, I take the job.}
{4030}{}{What's the pay?}
{4040}{}{I changed my mind.}
{5000}{}{I am riding with @lex caravan@ and right now I'm hiring caravan guards.}
{5010}{}{I need a job.}
{5020}{}{I'm looking for a job.}
{5030}{}{You're some kind of traveling traders?}
{5040}{}{What are the caravan guards doing?}
{5050}{}{Nice to meet you, but I gotta go.}
{6000}{}{I don't think we could use someone like you. You don't look like you could survive with us for long.}
{6010}{}{Nevermind then.}
{7000}{}{Yeah, we travel from town to town. When we arrive somewhere, we do some trade, hire more guards if necessary and then continue to next town.}
{7010}{}{I'm in.}
{7020}{}{Count me in.}
{7030}{}{What would be my job if I joined you as caravan guard?}
{7040}{}{Not interested.}
{8000}{}{Protecting the caravan of course.}
{8010}{}{I'm in.}
{8020}{}{Sounds like a job for me.}
{8030}{}{Not interested.}
{9000}{}{You get @lex money@, after we arrive at our destination.}
{9010}{}{OK, I take the job.}
{9020}{}{OK, I take the job.}
{9030}{}{Where were we headed again.}
{9040}{}{Not worth my time.}
{10000}{}{We are headed to @lex destination@ next and we're leaving at @lex time@.}
{10010}{}{OK, I take the job.}
{10020}{}{OK, I take the job.}
{10030}{}{What was the pay again?}
{10040}{}{I changed my mind.}
{11000}{}{Alright.}
{11010}{}{[Follow him.]}
{11020}{}{Hold on. I changed my mind.}
{12000}{}{We usually start loading an hour before departure. So if you're really interested get prepared and come back later.}
{12010}{}{Alright.}
{13000}{}{I don't talk with people like you.}
{13010}{}{What if I pay some caps?}
{13020}{}{Whatever, bye.}
{14000}{}{I might change my mind for 2500 bottle caps.}
{14010}{}{Here you go [you pay 2500 caps]}
{14020}{}{Nevermind.}
{15000}{}{We are riding with @lex caravan@. Sorry, we have all guards already.}
