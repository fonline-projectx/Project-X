{200}{}{You see a guard of Junktown.}
{240}{}{You see a dead guard of Junktown.}
{260}{}{You see a slain guard of Junktown.}
{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{It is dark outside...}
{1020}{}{Weapon in hand?}
{1030}{}{Answer text}
{2000}{}{Welcome to Junktown. What can I do for you?}
{2010}{}{What are you doing here? What is this place?}
{2020}{}{What is the local law regarding weapons?}
{2030}{}{Hey, where can I get some supplies?}
{2040}{}{Thanks, but I have to go...}
{2050}{}{Wa-wa!}
{3000}{}{Good you asked. No weapons can be drawn except in self-defense. If you start a fight, it's your fault. Other than that, it's your right to go around armed. Just don't pull a knife or gun without just cause. Have a good day.}
{3010}{}{Sounds fair. I have some other question.}
{4000}{}{You'd better put that away. Junktown is a friendly place, friend, and we want to keep it that way.}
{4010}{}{Put what away?}
{4020}{}{Uh, oh. Sorry.}
{5000}{}{Your weapon, idiot. Jeremiah won't take your arms away, but you'd better damn well keep them in your holster.}
{5010}{}{Oh, sorry.}
{5020}{}{No way! I'm not putting down my shooters for nobody!}
{6000}{}{You'd better behave, since it's the law, and I enforce the law. Put your weapon away. Don't draw it unless in self-defense and you won't have a problem with us guards. Disobey the law and we will return you to the lawless wasteland--dead or alive.}
{6010}{}{Bite your laws!}
{6020}{}{Don't tell me what to do, loser boy.}
{7000}{}{Sure, since you put it that way... [He grabs his weapon.]}
{7010}{}{[Combat]}
{7020}{}{Wait..! Wait! Calm down, I put away my weapon...}
{8000}{}{What does it look like? I'm a guard, and I'm keeping an eye out for strangers like you. And this place is called Junktown. Hey, don't laugh. I happen to like the name myself. We mostly do trading. Sometimes we trade with those stuck up bastards from Hub. Hey, you're not from the Hub are you?}
{8010}{}{What? The Hub? Sure I am!}
{8020}{}{Me? No, I'm not from the Hub.}
{9000}{}{Then you must know most of the rules. Have a good day. And I am sorry about the bastards part, OK?}
{9010}{}{Yeah! Hey, no problem. Bye.}
{9020}{}{It's going to cause me some severe mental trauma. Later.}
{10000}{}{Oh, heck. The place for that is Darkwater's. Jeremiah runs it. It's a little to the north. Jeremiah has the best supplies in town, so check it out.}
{10010}{}{Thanks for the info. I will check it out.@@Thanks. I will check it out.}
{10020}{}{You wanna show me where you keep "your" supplies?}
{10030}{}{I still have some other question.}
{11000}{}{Yeh?}
{11010}{}{What are you doing here? What is this place?}
{11020}{}{What is the local law regarding weapons?}
{11030}{}{Thanks for the infos, dude. I have to go now.}
{12000}{}{You'r lucky boy. I am not in the mood today to kill some asshole...}
{13000}{}{Uh, no. Sorry, lady. I got work to do here.}
{13010}{}{Oh boy, what a shame... [You leave.]}
{13020}{}{Oh boy, what a shame... anyway! I got some question to ya. }
{14000}{}{I'm sorry, the gates are closed for the night. Come back in the morning.}
{14010}{}{Hey, I need to get in!}
{14020}{}{No problem. See you in the morning.}
{14030}{}{Okay. But I have some important questions to you!}
{14040}{}{What if I do it anyway?}
{14050}{}{Whu..?}
{14060}{}{I really need to enter the town now.}
{14070}{}{I have a good stand with Junktown and need to enter the town.}
{15000}{}{Sorry, the rules are the rules. No strangers admitted during the night.}
{15010}{}{Okay...}
{16000}{}{Come . . . back . . . day . . .}
{16010}{}{Uh... }
{17000}{}{@sex@|We will shoot you, boy.||We will shoot you, lady.|}
{17010}{}{Okay, no problem. See you in the morning.}
{17020}{}{Okay. But I have some important questions to you!}
{18000}{}{Well. I'll guess I can make an exception for you. Come on in, but hurry up...}
{18010}{}{[Enter Junktown]}
{18020}{}{I have changed my mind. Goodbye.}
{100000001}{}{Welcome to Junktown, traveller!}

{100000003}{}{Guys, get him!}
