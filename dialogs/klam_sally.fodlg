{2000}{}{Hello there, my name’s Sally Dunton. Hmm, did you catch that?}
{2010}{}{Ally Onion? Gurk?}
{2020}{}{I gotta pee-ee}
{2030}{}{Oog? (shaking head)}
{3000}{}{Well, that’s a right nice try for an idjit. But I ain’t having none of your kind in here. Now, git out. Shoo, shoo.}
{4000}{}{I know you’re a tribal and all, but this is a bathhouse, not an outhouse. Git out afore I have you thrown out!}
{5000}{}{I won’t have you in my place. Now, get out.}
{6000}{}{My name’s Sally Dunton, but mostly they call me Big Nose Sally. I’m the owner of this here bathhouse. We have a whole hassleful of special, attended baths for you to pick from.}
{6010}{}{What kind of special, attended baths do you have here?}
{6020}{}{Gee, Miss Sally, I just wanted a regular bath. You don’t have a bubble bath, do you?}
{6030}{}{I think I’ve changed my mind; I may try back later.}
{7000}{}{My name’s ‘Big Nose’ Sally Dunton and I’m the owner of this here bathhouse. I’m afraid that we just have girl bath attendants here. That alright with you?}
{7010}{}{I’m just here for a bath.}
{7020}{}{Women suit me just fine.}
{7030}{}{Gee, I was really looking for a male attendant.}
{7040}{}{I don’t think this is what I was looking for.}
{8000}{}{I’m sorry that we couldn’t help you out. Come on back later, though.}
{8010}{}{Alright, thanks anyway. Bye.}
{9000}{}{If you just want an unattended bath, you might try the Golden Gecko or the Buckner House. But I doubt that you’ll find that as enjoyable.}
{9010}{}{Thanks, Miss Big Nose. I’ll try that instead. Good-bye.}
{9020}{}{I was just kidding; I’d like a special bath.}
{10000}{}{The special baths that we have available vary in cost by the amount of time that the gal spends with you, and any special services that you take advantage of.}
{10010}{}{You mean I get to be with a real-live girl? Sign me up!}
{10020}{}{I don’t think I’m ready for this; I better go.}
{10030}{}{I think that the appearance of the attendant better figure into the cost, too.}
{11000}{}{The baths that we have available are: a Wash Cloth Hand Wipe, a brief Full Body Wash, and, lastly, the Round-the-World Full Squeaky Clean Servicing, offered by the beautiful and talented Jenny, recently trained at the finest house in the Den.}
{11010}{}{I think I can get by with the Hand Wipe; how much is that?}
{11020}{}{Sounds like quite a fella, Bob, but I've got some other questions.}
{11030}{}{Beautiful and talented? I’ve got to hear more about the Round-the-World Full Squeaky Clean Wash.}
{11040}{}{I don’t think I’m ready to take a bath with someone else watching; I’m going to leave.}
{11050}{}{Can I mix and match the different types of baths?}
{11060}{}{What about getting a discount on those baths?}
{12000}{}{No, you have to choose one at a time, but you can always come back for more -- usually after a brief rest.}
{12010}{}{Tell me the different types of bath again.}
{12020}{}{If I can’t make my own combinations, I don’t even want a bath; I’m outta here.}
{13000}{}{I think any of our girls would be happy to give you a full body wash; I just better watch the time to make sure it’s a brief one (chuckle). The Brief Full Body Wash will cost you $55.}
{13010}{}{That sounds like fun. Here’s my $55.}
{13020}{}{Sorry, don't think I can afford that.}
{13030}{}{Hmm, what are the other choices again?}
{13040}{}{Thanks, but I think that I’ll save my money for now.}
{14000}{}{Well I’m sure that your Round-the-World trip Servicing with beautiful Jenny will be an experience that you’ll savor for quite a while. A real bargain at only $125.}
{14010}{}{I can’t wait to enjoy Jenny’s special talents. Here’s my $125.}
{14020}{}{I don't think I have that much on me.}
{14030}{}{Maybe I should hear about the other bath choices again.}
{14040}{}{I don’t think that I’ll ever need $125 worth of cleaning. I’m going to leave before I get myself into trouble.}
{15000}{}{Well, for an attractive individual like yourself that would only cost $15.}
{15010}{}{$15? That’s a bargain; I’ll take it.}
{15020}{}{Sorry, I don't think I have $15.}
{15030}{}{Hmm, tell me about the other types of baths again.}
{15040}{}{Maybe I don’t need this right now. I’m leaving.}
{16000}{}{Back again, huh? A lot of folks just can’t seem to get clean enough.}
{16010}{}{I’m just looking around this time; I don’t need a bath.}
{16020}{}{Tell me the types of bath that you have again.}
{16030}{}{Do I get a return customer discount?}
{17000}{}{Well now, it wouldn’t be fair to discount any of our services. My gals are well worth what they charge.}
{17010}{}{I guess that’s fair enough. Tell me what baths you have available.}
{17020}{}{Well, if I can’t get a discount, I’m leaving.}
{18000}{}{It seems as though your eyes are bigger than your budget. Perhaps you’d like to try a cheaper washing.}
{18010}{}{Yeah, maybe. Bye.}
{19000}{}{Best money you ever spent!}
{20000}{}{Now hold on, we can't have folks like you in my establishment. You ain't to be trusted. Now go on, git!}
