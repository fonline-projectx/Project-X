{2000}{}{Oh come on! I don't have time to talk, get out of my sight!}
{2010}{}{What is going on here?}
{2020}{}{Tell me about the situation again.}
{2030}{}{Goodbye.}
{3000}{}{I told your friends already, the subway tunnel are closed off! As long as nobody is going to get down there, we will not open the gates!}
{3010}{}{Wait, you guys actually got a working subway station down here?}
{3020}{}{Fine by me. See you around.}
{4000}{}{What? No! The squatters live down there. Well, they had, until the radscorpion family broke into it and is now housing there. You are not one of them? }
{4010}{}{Maybe I can help you with those radscorpions.}
{4020}{}{Maybe I can help you with those radscorpions.}
{4030}{}{That sounds horrible! Anyway, have to go now...}
{5000}{}{You like to make unfunny jokes, do you? That scorpions are big and dangerous. Someone fresh one like you, they will rip apart.}
{5010}{}{You are sure?}
{6000}{}{Pretty much, yes.}
{6010}{}{Then I might consider to come back later. So long, bye.}
{7000}{}{That would be a tough job to do, but hey... maybe you could pull it off, I don't know. You want to try it? Fine by me.}
{7010}{}{[Continue]}
{7020}{}{Maybe later, can't do it right now. Bye.}
{8000}{}{And? What's the status?}
{8010}{}{The radscorpions down in the tunnels are dead.}
{8020}{}{I forgot something and have to go back into the subway station.}
{8030}{}{Don't have much time right now. Will come back to you later.}
{9000}{}{Glad you came along to help us.@@Thanks for helping us.@@Thanks again for the help.}
{10000}{}{The damn radscorpions have finally taken over all subway tunnels. We can't get down there anymore without spending a lot manpower on it... thanks for the help.}
{11000}{}{If you say so...}
{11010}{}{[Continue]}
{12000}{}{You really are helpful!}
{13000}{}{That's... impressive! Thought you would die down there, just like the other ones who tried so far... Can't give you much, though. How about this: The last one trying to help was poisoned so bad, he died a short time after. He got this 14mm pistol... [He shows you the gun.] ... You can have it, if you want to.}
{13010}{}{Give me the gun, that's fine.}
{13020}{}{I don't need weapons. Give me caps instead!}
{14000}{}{Hope this one will keep you going! [He hands you over the heavy looking 14mm pistol and some ammunition for it.]}
{14010}{}{Goodbye.}
{15000}{}{If that suits you better... Here, take some caps. Still, thanks a lot for your help.}
{15010}{}{Goodbye.}
