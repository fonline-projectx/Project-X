{100}{}{Heurelho Gomes}
{200}{}{You see Gomes.}
{200}{}{You see Heurelho.}
{210}{}{You see Heurelho Gomes. He is in charge of the outside camp.}
{210}{}{You see a tough-looking raider who is evidently in charge of proceedings.}
{210}{}{You see a Khan with powerful biceps and a fatalistic expression.}
{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{Attack if you bother him}
{1020}{}{Hostile to good people}
{1030}{}{First talk.}
{1040}{}{If player brings NCR Ranger (or some other) Dogtags}
{1050}{}{Known.}
{1060}{}{Slaver (should go to #7 when slavers implemented)}
{2000}{}{I know you?}
{2010}{}{Don't think so. I'm @pname@.}
{2020}{}{No, and you never will. Prepare to die, dickshit.}
{2030}{}{Sorry, wrong person. Bye.}
{3000}{}{I'm Gomes. What are you doing here?}
{3010}{}{Just looking for work.}
{3020}{}{Just chewing the fat. What do you do here?}
{3030}{}{Just hanging out. Take it easy now. Bye Gomes.}
{4000}{}{We're good for hired help right now. If you want some dishonest work, go check out the Den. Metzger always needs people.}
{4010}{}{Metzger, okay. Thanks for the tip.}
{5000}{}{I make sure no stupid shit happens. Annoyingly, it's more work than you might think.}
{5010}{}{Yeah?}
{6000}{}{Well, we get all sorts here. Mostly Khans, sure, but we get regular visits from slavers, unscrupulous traders, a whole bunch of various criminals, and a few wastelanders who just don't like civilised society. Not everyone gets along all the time, especially with that moonshine Augustus serves every hour of the day.}
{6010}{}{Makes sense. Well, you need a hand?}
{6020}{}{Makes sense. Well, nice talking to you.}
{7000}{}{Howdy slaver. If you got goods to sell, talk to Ashdown near the pen.}
{7010}{}{Actually I wanted to ask you something else.}
{7020}{}{Thanks, I'll go check her out.}
{8000}{}{Well, what do you want?}
{8010}{}{Just looking for work.}
{8020}{}{Just chewing the fat. What do you do here?}
{8030}{}{Just hanging out. Take it easy now. Bye Gomes.}
{9000}{}{Good to see you again, @pname@.}
{9010}{}{Yeah you too. Can I ask you something?}
{9020}{}{Yeah you too. Goodbye Heurelho.}
{10000}{}{What the fuck are ya doin' here, man? Get lost before someone shoots ya!@@We don't like your kind here. You better get the fuck outta here, before getting bullet in the back.@@Man, I would dissapear from this place if I were you.}
{11000}{}{That's it man, you're history!}
{12000}{}{Hey, wait! What's that?}
{12010}{}{This? I just killed some Ranger Dogs a while ago, they were sqealing for mercy as I busted their guts all over the sand, man! Picked up a souvenir or two, just in case more of them show up -- they'll know their end is nigh.}
{12020}{}{Nothing special, really. [Leave]}
{13000}{}{Gimme that, there's people around here who'll be happy to see such souvenirs! And if you have any more of these, bring'em over here and I'll put a good word for ya among the crowd.}
{13010}{}{Sure, there you go. [Give him 1 dogtag]}
{13020}{}{Sure, there you go. [Give him 3 dogtags]}
{13030}{}{Sure, there you go. [Give him 5 dogtags]}
{13040}{}{Sure, there you go. [Give him 10 dogtags]}
{13050}{}{I think I'll keep them for a while longer. [Leave]}
{14000}{}{Just one? Better than nothing, I guess. Now, beat it!}
{15000}{}{Yeah, three is good.}
{16000}{}{Five, gimme five for this! **clap**}
{17000}{}{Ten is some serious shit, man! I'll tell everyone we've gotta new champ around here, yeah!}
{18000}{}{Beat it, ya little punk!@@Wasting my time, little@sex@|fucker||bitch|...}
