It smells like...rain@@Now where did I put that hatchet?}
{18000}{}{Well howdy there, stranger! The name's ol' @lex name@, I'm a farmer here in town. But if it doesn't rain soon, I'll be out of a job. }
{18010}{}{How about working for me and @lex faction@ then? We'll provide food, supplies, and shelter for your family. What do you say?}
{18020}{}{Come work with @lex faction@, I can't promise rain but it's sure as hell better then sitting around here and slaving for a bunch of redneck assholes.}
{18030}{}{Tough luck then. Well, I'll be seeing you. If I come across any tribals I'll aim for their feet and make em' dance for ya' so it rains!}
{19000}{}{Ya' really mean it? Well gee-wilikers, stranger! That sounds like a mighty fine deal right there. But I owe one of the townsfolk five grands and I won't be able to leave here until I pay my debts. Can you help me out with some caps? I promise you won't be dissapointed.}
{19010}{}{Alright, that's no problem. Here's the caps to pay your debt, don't lose them.}
{19020}{}{I'll have to think about this one. Goodbye, I'll be back when I've made up my mind.}
{20000}{}{Work wit' yous? No thank you, I'll take my chances with the rain here in town. The only reason I'm still here is that my family and I just can't afford to move outta' town. What with all the lack of rains and all's. Unless you got a gang of tribals that can dance to make it rain, then I ain't interested. Come back when your a bit more persuasive, or can make it rain!}
{20010}{}{That's your loss then. I hope it rains soon. Goodbye}
{21000}{}{Well hot-dog stranger! Lemme' just run over to Blacks, pay my debt, then get my family ready to relocate. Draw me a map to your base and I'll be over there faster then you can skin a torn up gecko!}
{21010}{}{Don't take all day. You work for @lex faction@ now.}
{22000}{}{@lex faction@ Here I come! Thanks a million stranger.}
{100000001}{}{Doo-be-doo-doo-doo...}
{100000002}{}{Mighty boring around these parts.}
{100000003}{}{Golly, these pants sure are tight.}
{100000004}{}{*Whistles*}
{100000005}{}{Weather's better on the West coast.}
{100000006}{}{What the heck are ya' lookin' at?}
{100000007}{}{It sure would be swell to shoot something...}
{100000008}{}{Maybe, you'll think of meeeeee...when you are all...}
{100000009}{}{If you think you can do a better job, then bring it on fancy pants!}
{100000010}{}{Geez, I'm wrecked...}
{100000011}{}{I'd better get back to work.}
