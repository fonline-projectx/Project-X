{2000}{}{What have you been getting yourself into? Let old Doc Johnson take a look at ya.}
{2010}{}{Thanks, Doc. How much will this cost?}
{2020}{}{I just wanted to try to buy some supplies.}
{2030}{}{I don't need healing right now so much as some answers to some questions.}
{2040}{}{Nice to meet you, but I don't think any healing's needed right now. Thanks anyway, Doc. Goodbye.}
{3000}{}{Looks like you got caught on the short end of the stick. I'm Doc Johnson, and I can patch you up if you want.}
{3010}{}{Well, I...}
{4000}{}{Got yourself all scraped up, huh? Well, let Doc Johnson take a look at that. Easy now, I'm a professional.}
{4010}{}{It ain't as bad as it looks. Okay, maybe it is. Be gentle.}
{5000}{}{What have you been getting yourselves into? Gosh, that looks painful. Let old Doc Johnson take a look at ya.}
{5010}{}{I regret everything I've ever done.}
{6000}{}{What would you like to know?}
{6010}{}{You are the town's jet dealer, right?}
{6020}{}{Got any medical supplies you want to trade?}
{6030}{}{I am quite interested into medicine myself, and this is the reason I am visiting you today. My hopes are that you could share some of your knowledge and experience with me...}
{6040}{}{I was just looking around. Goodbye, Doc.}
{7000}{}{I might be able to provide you with some supplies; let's see what you've got in trade.}
{7010}{}{Okay, Doc.}
{7020}{}{I didn't mean right now. I was just wondering if you had stuff to trade. I have some questions, though.}
{7030}{}{Oh, I don't need anything right now. See you later, Doc.}
{8000}{}{Gosh darn it! You're bleeding all over my floor!}
{8010}{}{Wow, I sure do have a lot of blood in me, don't I Doc? Well. Used to.}
{9000}{}{Well, I can try to fix you up and cure what ails you, but it's going to cost you $@lex price@. Want me to have at it?}
{9010}{}{Yes, please. Here's your money, Doc.}
{9020}{}{We can't afford that right now. Sorry, Doc, maybe another time.}
{9030}{}{Maybe I'll have that done later. Goodbye, Doc.}
{10000}{}{I'd sure like to help you, but you don't have enough to cover your bill. Medical supplies cost money.}
{10010}{}{I don't have cash, but I have stuff to barter. Can I trade you something for your services?}
{10020}{}{I'll come back when I have more money. Goodbye.}
{11000}{}{What does this look like to you? A general store? No, I don't barter for medical services. I just want payment in honest gold dollars, thank you very much. Come back when you have some.}
{11010}{}{I didn't mean right now. I was just wondering if you had stuff to trade. I have some questions, though.}
{11020}{}{All right. I get the picture. Goodbye.}
{12000}{}{Wouldn't let that go too long. Some wounds fester and start oozing puss. Then there's always gangrene. Course, lately, I haven't used my knives as much as I'd like. Getting a bit rusty. Tell you what: Go ahead and let it go as long as you want. Maybe I can get some practice later on.}
{12010}{}{I see. While I'm festering, let me ask you about something.}
{12020}{}{Uh, yeah, well I'll think about that. Goodbye, Doc.}
{13000}{}{There you go. You're all set.}
{13010}{}{Thanks doctor.}
{14000}{}{Your head is larger than I would think.@@Your beetling brow confirms my suspicions.@@You have a very well developed sagittal crest.@@I wonder if it was long exposure to radiation that so reduced your cranial capacity.@@No food here. Go away!@@Shoo, shoo!@@Go back to the wilderness, you savage.}
{15000}{}{Oh, a colleague! It's not that I meet colleagues every day, you know... The reason more to say that I am very pleased to have you here. So, what did you want us to talk about then?}
{15010}{}{I was hoping you can show me how to perform simple surgeries and... [You explain what you need]}
{15020}{}{Well, I was interested in more complex methods of saving human lives, which would consider... [You explain him what you need]}
{15030}{}{I, erhm... Not quite sure where to start from. Maybe I should drop a little bit later. [Leave]}
{16000}{}{Sure, sure... We can already arrange something, I guess. But I would like to have something in return, a kind of compensation for my time and work. It's not that I'm trying to earn something out of this, but a help from a colleague like you would be quite appreciated. I'll keep it short then -- I would need $1500 for a short lesson or $3000 for one with more details.}
{16010}{}{You don't have to worry, my appreciated colleague, I have $1500 right here! [You give him $1500]}
{16020}{}{You don't have to worry, my appreciated colleague, I have $3000 right here! [You give him $3000]}
{16030}{}{Well, I should start gathering some healing herbs then. See you later, doctor Johnson!}
{17000}{}{Excellent! Then we should waste no more time, let's begin... [Doctor Johnson starts to show you his healing and surgery methods. After the session, you get a book from him.]}
{17010}{}{Thank you very much, doctor Johnson! I will do my best to put this knowledge to a good use, I assure you. Have a nice day!}
{18000}{}{Excellent! Then we should waste no more time, let's begin... [Doctor Johnson starts to show you his healing and surgery methods]}
{18010}{}{Thank you very much, doctor Johnson! I will do my best to put this knowledge to a good use, I assure you. Have a nice day!}
{19000}{}{Ratt, I didn't know you had a brother.@@Ratt, get this 'thing' out of here.@@Get out of my clinic!@@Get out, right now!@@You're fucking hideous.}
{20000}{}{That is correct.}
{20010}{}{Don't you think that's a bit fucked up? You're the town doctor, man.}
{20020}{}{Alright, so you probably have a good idea of the town's demand for jet?}
{21000}{}{"Fucked up"?  You would rather they bought it for twice the price from a criminal, after it's been cut with who knows what?}
{21010}{}{But, you're like, the go-to guy when people have problems. But here you are tacitly condoning drug addiction.}
{21020}{}{But, you're like, the go-to guy when people have problems. But here you are tacitly condoning drug addiction.}
{22000}{}{I don't want to meddle with their affairs. I'm not their father, I'm their doctor. They choose to take drugs, and I help them do it in the safest way they can.}
{22010}{}{Fair enough. Let me ask you something else.}
{22020}{}{Fair enough.}
{23000}{}{Hmm. I suppose you are right. Perhaps it is my duty. Anyway, this is all hypothetical; I don't have the resources to run that sort of programme.}
{23010}{}{Doctor Johnson, I'll look in to this for you. If I can ever send some resources your way, I'll do it. [You feel warm inside for persuading Doc Johnson to become a humanitarian.]}
{24000}{}{Everyone who buys jet in this town buys it from me. And I keep meticulous records.}
{24010}{}{Perrrfect. Any chance I could grab those and take them to Renesco in Reno in order to increase Redding's order? And maybe I could say some more words that start with 'R'.}
{25000}{}{I knew they would come in handy one day.}
{25010}{}{Thanks. [Taking the receipts and order notes and stuffing them in your pocket.] You know, you seem pretty blase about this.}
{26000}{}{Just pragmatic. I do make a little bit of money selling jet you know. No harm in more.}
{26010}{}{You're a weird man, Johnson. Thanks for the info.}
