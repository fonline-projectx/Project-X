{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{We are talking the first time.}
{1020}{}{We talked already.}
{2000}{}{What, what the hell do you want from me now?}
{2010}{}{Eh, nothing. Bye.}
{2020}{}{Slow down, what's your problem?}
{2030}{}{The dogs are dead. }

{2050}{}{I want to kill another pair of dogs.}
{2060}{}{I want to kill another pair of dogs.}
{2070}{}{What do you know about the dogs?}
{2080}{}{Can you tell me something about the salvagers?}
{3000}{}{What the hell do you want from me?}
{3010}{}{Just looking around, thanks and bye.}
{3020}{}{Slow down, what's your problem?}
{4000}{}{The dogs! The god damn dogs. }
{4010}{}{What's up with the dogs?}
{4020}{}{Sounds like you've got a hella fun with dogs.}
{4030}{}{That's cool. Really. See you later.}
{5000}{}{They are just everywhere! And they fucking eat the fucking salvagers...}
{5010}{}{[Listen]}
{6000}{}{... and they overrun our boneyard camps....}
{6010}{}{[Listen]}
{7000}{}{...yesterday, they have been close to the main gates...}
{7010}{}{[Listen]}
{8000}{}{...you want to salvage some metal parts? Fuck it! Some dog of a bastard is going to ruin your day and will attack you....}
{8010}{}{[Listen]}
{8020}{}{Enough! [You interrupt him.] Tell me where the damn dogs are and I'll hang 'em up.}
{9000}{}{...and I tell you, they are not the normal dogs...}
{9010}{}{[Listen]}
{9020}{}{Enough! [You interrupt him.] Tell me where the damn dogs are and I'll hang 'em up.}
{10000}{}{...they are like... I don't know. But you see it in their eyes...}
{10010}{}{[Listen]}
{10020}{}{Enough! [You interrupt him.] Tell me where the damn dogs are and I'll hang 'em up.}
{11000}{}{...they are yellow. And god damn, these fuckers look angry...}
{11010}{}{[Listen]}
{11020}{}{Enough! [You interrupt him.] Tell me where the damn dogs are and I'll hang 'em up.}
{12000}{}{...and hungry, but they eat all the time...}
{12010}{}{[Listen]}
{12020}{}{Enough! [You interrupt him.] Tell me where the damn dogs are and I'll hang 'em up.}
{13000}{}{...few days ago, a salvagers camp in the east of the Boneyard got overrun... }
{13010}{}{[Listen]}
{13020}{}{Enough! [You interrupt him.] Tell me where the damn dogs are and I'll hang 'em up.}
{14000}{}{...only a few managed it to survive the attack...}
{14010}{}{[Listen]}
{14020}{}{Enough! [You interrupt him.] Tell me where the damn dogs are and I'll hang 'em up.}
{15000}{}{...we don't even know why the god damn dogs are like that...}
{15010}{}{[Listen]}
{15020}{}{Enough! [You interrupt him.] Tell me where the damn dogs are and I'll hang 'em up.}
{16000}{}{...you can just kill them. And again. And again... }
{16010}{}{[Listen]}
{16020}{}{Enough! [You interrupt him.] Tell me where the damn dogs are and I'll hang 'em up.}
{17000}{}{...but there will be always more. They are like rabbits. God damn dogs...}

{18010}{}{What's the problem with the dogs?}
{18020}{}{I'll make fun about what I want! Bye.}
{19000}{}{That would you do? But... but they can make easy meat out of you!}
{19010}{}{I am tough enough, I can do it. Just tell me where they are and what I will get, when I get rid of them.}
{19020}{}{Killing dogs sounds like fun and that's what I am searching for. Now tell me where the fuck the dogs are.}
{19030}{}{That was just a lie. Bye.}
{20000}{}{We can pay you in various ammo types for every dead group of dogs. }
{20010}{}{Okay. Show me where the dogs are right now.}
{20020}{}{What, for this I am not even going out of the bed.}
{21000}{}{I am sorry, but we can't pay you more. Take it or leave it.}
{21010}{}{Okay. Show me where the dogs are right now.}
{22000}{}{Here, [He points you to a map on the table.] that's where we got the last salvagers reports. }
{22010}{}{I am on my way.}
{23000}{}{I know that they are god damn bastards. We are not sure why there are so many of them, but it's a hell of a job to get rid of them.}
{23010}{}{And there is no chance to get them away for a longer time?}
{23020}{}{Something else...}
{23030}{}{That's all I wanted. See you.}
{24000}{}{Great! Here is the position of another dog group... [He points you to a map on the table.] ... that's where we got the last salvagers reports. }
{24010}{}{Fine. I will check it out.}
{25000}{}{What, really? Great! Here is your reward. [He gives you some ammo.]}
{25010}{}{Thanks. See you later.}
{26000}{}{We tried already a lot shit. Even some chemicals from Miles, but nothing worked. They are just everywhere. }
{26010}{}{Something else, if you don't mind...}
{26020}{}{That's all I wanted. See you.}
{27000}{}{They are free workers who go through the ruins and search for junk, metal, usable stuff... Everything that can be reused.}
{27010}{}{Where can I find the salvagers?}
{27020}{}{That's all I wanted to know. Bye.}
{28000}{}{They are in the north west of here. It's an bigger building with many people running around... You can't really miss it.}
{28010}{}{That's all I wanted to know. Bye.}
{29000}{}{Great! But... How unbelievable it even sounds, but... It looks like the amount of dog packs has been decreased drastically over the last time. The ruin crawlers didn't met any since a while. }
{29010}{}{Okay. Maybe I will check you out later again. Bye.}
{29020}{}{The dogs are gone?}
{30000}{}{Well, I wouldn't count on that. There have been always periods of time, where we could beat them off a bit. And they always came back. So... if you come back later, I can guarantee you, that we got new reports about attacks.}
{30010}{}{Okay. Maybe I will check you out later again. Bye.}
{31000}{}{Great! But... How unbelievable it even sounds, but... The ruin crawlers didn't met any pack of dogs since a while. You should check back, when I got a new report.}
{31010}{}{Okay. Maybe I will check you out later again. Bye.}
