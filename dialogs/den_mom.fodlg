{2000}{}{Hello there, my name's Mom and I run this place. Got the best food north of New Reno, too.}
{2010}{}{You're not my mom.}
{2020}{}{What do you have to eat here?}
{2030}{}{I noticed there are a lot of orphans around town.}
{2040}{}{Grisham sent me, Mom. I've got a big bag o' jerky with your name on it.}
{2050}{}{I should go, goodbye.}
{3000}{}{What did you want to talk to Mom about?}
{3010}{}{You're not my mom.}
{3020}{}{What do you have to eat here?}
{3030}{}{I noticed there are a lot of orphans around town.}
{3040}{}{I should go, goodbye.}
{4000}{}{I know that. But everyone calls me that. Heck, I even treat people like they're my kin - long as you obey my rules that is.}
{4010}{}{Rules?}
{5000}{}{That's right. No stealing, no cursing, and no fighting - not in my shop you don't. 'Cause if'n you do, out you'll go. I like things peaceful here.}
{5010}{}{I see. Let me ask you something else.}
{5020}{}{That makes sense. See you later, Mom.}
{6000}{}{Yes, isn't it a shame? These children have no home and many steal for a living...it's terrible. I had an idea some years back to start an orphanage but no one was really that interested. It's a shame really. Children are our future...}
{6010}{}{It is a shame. Let me ask you something else.}
{6020}{}{Maybe you will someday, bye.}
{7000}{}{Oh, you're a dear. Maybe Grisham'll send you back my way some other time. Here's a couple caps, go get yourself a nice hot meal.}
{7010}{}{Thanks Mom!}
{8000}{}{I'll leave you some scraps out back.@@Oh, you poor thing.@@Please! Folks, it's rude to stare!@@I'm sorry, they can't quit staring.}
