{100}{}{Mikey}
{200}{}{You see a sharp-dressed guy hawking lizard kebabs.}
{210}{}{It's the lizard-on-a-stick vendor.}
{210}{}{For a lizard-on-a-stick vendor, this guy's got style. He's clean, well-dressed and runs a pretty spotless little operation.}
{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{2}
{2000}{}{Hungry, stranger? I got the best lizard around. Ask anybody!}
{2010}{}{Sure, let's see what you got.}
{2020}{}{What can you tell me about this town?}
{2030}{}{Grisham sent me. I got a big bag of jerky with your name on, pal.}
{2040}{}{I have a message for you from your father}
{2050}{}{Goodbye.}
{3000}{}{Look, I got a rule. I don't say nothing about nobody. It's a good rule, because if I keep my mouth shut, I keep out of trouble. Capice?}
{3010}{}{Fine. Look, I'm hungry.}
{3020}{}{Sorry for troubling, Christ!}
{4000}{}{Nice job, I was nearly fresh out. Here's a few bucks for you trouble. Maybe Grisham'll send you down my way again sometime.}
{4010}{}{No problem. See you later.}
{5000}{}{Is that supposed to be a joke? Get out of here before I call the guards.}
{5010}{}{No really, he says he forgives you.  You can go back and sell your shit with him in The Hub, instead of stinking up the bazaar here in Shady Sands.}
{6000}{}{This 'shit' I'm selling is making me a profit!  More in a day, than you make in a month, and my pa died before I was even born, so unless you're a goddamn ghost I think you've got the wrong guy.}
{6010}{}{But it says Son of Bob right there on the cart!}
{6020}{}{I am a ghost! I came from the underworld to tell you that your father is disappointed in your career choices, and thinks you could do better with your life!}
{7000}{}{So? There's a lot of signs around, don't mean anything. Son of Bobs was on this stand when I got it.}
{7010}{}{Well where'd you get it?}
{8000}{}{If I tell you will you leave? Hell, it doesn't matter.  I got it from a bet with the big green guy over at the Rawhide Saloon. Muties are stupid enough to fall for anything around here.}
{8010}{}{Here's a cap for the info, goodbye Son of Bob.}
{8020}{}{Right... see you later, Son of Bob...}
{9000}{}{Gee thanks, I'll try not to spend it all at once.}
{10000}{}{Get outta here!}
{10010}{}{OOOoooooOOooooooo!}
{11000}{}{My name is Mike, asshole!}
