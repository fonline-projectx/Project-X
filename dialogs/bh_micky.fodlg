{100}{}{Mickey}
{200}{}{You see a short, spry gentleman.}
{210}{}{You see Micky, the treasure hunter.}
{210}{}{This very short man looks friendly and brave. His gaze darts around as if looking for shiny objects.}
{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{dumb}
{1020}{}{normal}
{2000}{}{Hey there, friend! Haven't seen any jewels or precious metals lying around anywhere, have ya'?}
{2010}{}{No trezhuur tooday.}
{2020}{}{Who U?}
{2030}{}{Baii.}
{3000}{}{Hey there, friend! Haven't seen any jewels or precious metals lying around anywhere, have ya'?}
{3010}{}{No, not today. If I run across any, I'll let you know, though.}
{3020}{}{What's your name?}
{3030}{}{No, but how about you tell me how do you find these *treasures* yourself? [Treasure Hunter]}
{3040}{}{Actually, I happened to stumble upon some of those the other day. Selling them for a fair price brought me a small fortune, so I felt I owe you your share. There you go, partner! [Give $50]}
{3050}{}{Hey Mickey, how's your *treasure hunt* going? Hahahaha! [You walk away laughing]}
{3060}{}{Never mind.}
{4000}{}{Me? I'm Micky, suave and debonaire Treasure Hunter of Broken Hills.}
{4010}{}{Treasure Hunter?}
{4020}{}{How nice. Good day.}
{5000}{}{Me? I'm Micky, suave and debonaire Treasure Hunter of Broken Hills.}
{5010}{}{Hunnterr?}
{5020}{}{Bye-bye.}
{6000}{}{Don't tell me you haven't heard of me! You've never been told of the tales of the Fast Micky? Of his running gun battles, two-fisted action, and pernicious plunderings?}
{6010}{}{I'm afraid I've never had the pleasure.}
{6020}{}{Sorry pal, bye.}
{7000}{}{Don't tell me you haven't heard of me! You've never been told of the tales of the Fast Micky? Of his running gun battles, two-fisted action, and pernicious plunderings?}
{7010}{}{Nup.}
{8000}{}{Well, you're missing out, friend. One of these days I'll have to fill you in on the gory details.}
{8010}{}{How about you tell me how you find these *treasures* instead? [Treasure Hunter]}
{8020}{}{I'll be waiting with bated breath.}
{9000}{}{Well, you're missing out, friend. One of these days I'll have to fill you in on the gory details.}
{9010}{}{Goodeee.}
{10000}{}{Oh well. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. The market for Treasure Hunters has really dropped in recent years. The whole death and famine and fight-for-survival thing really hurts people's sense of adventure. Keep me in mind, though, if anything comes up.}
{10010}{}{You'll be the first on my list.}
{11000}{}{Oh well. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. The market for Treasure Hunters has really dropped in recent years. The whole death and famine and fight-for-survival thing really hurts people's sense of adventure. Keep me in mind, though, if anything comes up.}
{11010}{}{Okee-dokee.}
{12000}{}{Only if you promise to tell me about any treasures you may find on your journeys, and give me a small share of those. Deal, partner?}
{12010}{}{Deal! [Truth]}
{12020}{}{It's a deal, partner! [Lie]}
{12030}{}{Deals with you are as shady as it gets, forget it! Have a nice day, *treasure hunter*.}
{13000}{}{Okay, here's how I do it... [You listen and watch carefully]}
{13010}{}{That was some presentation, I tell ya! Now, let me start looking for treasures right away, I'm eager to put your words to work.}
