{200}{}{You see a little grease-stained guy.}
{210}{}{You're looking at Buster, the gun guy.}

{2000}{}{Hey, welcome to Buster's Fine Emporium of Armament! I'm Buster and there ain't nobody else. Got some fine goods here and on my shelves. Check it out. I'm ready to deal.}
{2010}{}{What do you got?}
{2020}{}{I've got some questions.}
{2030}{}{I've got your Gun Runners shipment with me.}
{2040}{}{Got any work for me, Buster?}
{2050}{}{Goodbye.}
{3000}{}{Hey, back again? What can I do for you?}

{4010}{}{Tell me about the NCR.}
{4020}{}{What's the deal with Merk?}
{4030}{}{What can you tell me about Frank Westin?}
{4040}{}{Nothing. Forget it. Bye.}
{5000}{}{New California Republic - that's what it is. President Tandi and the bunch say they're trying to rebuild the old days; I figure they're just trying to grab whatever they can. Hell, I got no complaint with them - the old days is all before my time. They're kind of a prissy bunch, though - don't like slaves, gambling, whatnot. That's why I set up out here. Don't like rules - never have.}
{5010}{}{I see. I wanted to know something else.}
{5020}{}{That's all for now. Goodbye.}
{6000}{}{I don't mess with Mr. Merk and it don't pay to go gossiping about him. You got questions, go ask about him at the Rawhide.}
{6010}{}{I see. I wanted to know something else.}
{6020}{}{Duly noted. See ya.}
{7000}{}{Frank Westin? You mean that Congress guy? Got himself a spread out west of town.  Brahmin man - big wheel in the Stockman's Association. He's always looking for hands, if you're wanting work.}
{7010}{}{Interesting. Tell me something else.}
{7020}{}{Good for him. Goodbye.}
{8000}{}{You better get outta here before something hits ya... Hard.@@Funny fella, aintcha? Beat it.@@Don't touch anything! It can blow your empty head off!@@Get lost, freakshow.}

{10000}{}{Little down on your luck, huh? I been there. Run down to the Rawhide, pick me up three packs o' smokes, an' I'll throw a couple bucks your way. Deal? I'd do it myself, but I can't leave this place alone for a minute.}
{10010}{}{Sure thing. Back in a second.}
{10020}{}{I'm not buying your damn cigarettes. I'm outta here.}
{11000}{}{Thanks, buddy. Here's a couple bucks. I better get back to work. See you around.}
{11010}{}{Thanks Buster. I'll catch you later.}
{12000}{}{Wait, 'fore you go, you could probably use this old jacket I had lying around. Take care of yourself out there.}
{12010}{}{Thanks, Buster! Say, you don't happen to have a lighter somewhere around here, do ya?}
{12020}{}{Thanks, Buster! Say, you don't happen to have a lighter somewhere around here, do ya?}
{12030}{}{Hey, thanks! Let me try it out right away! [Leave]}
{13000}{}{A passionate smoker, aintcha? Here, this one's on the house. Drop by anytime if you need any more of these.}
{13010}{}{You're the best, Buster, I'll put up a good word about you among my buddies. Bye!}
{14000}{}{One lighter, hundred caps. You got the caps, you walk outta this place as a happy owner of a *working* lighter. [You can use SAY to enter number of items you want to buy]}
{14010}{}{Just gimme the damn thing already, I'm in a hurry! [Give him $100 and leave]}
{14020}{}{Hm, I'm short on money right now... I'll come back later.}
{15000}{}{Man, it's about time! Give it to me, had been waiting for the delivery since weeks!@@About time! Give me the package and thanks.@@Thanks for the delivery, @sex@|boy||girl|, it's about time!@@Ah, finally! Hand it over, I'll take care from now on.}
