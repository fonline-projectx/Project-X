{100}{}{Liz}
{200}{}{You see a woman wearing a perpetual scowl.}
{210}{}{You see Liz, the manager of the General Store.}
{210}{}{You see a middle-aged woman whose scowl has eroded her face. She looks like one of those people who takes a perverse pleasure in a hard life.}
{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{ugly}

{2000}{}{Hi. I’m Liz. What do you want?}
{2010}{}{Nggg! Nnnnnng!}
{2020}{}{Me nget ssssstUFF!}
{3000}{}{Oh, god… another addle-headed mutant baby. When will someone just shoot these things?}
{3010}{}{Gurgle.}
{4000}{}{Speak slowly and clearly and I’ll see if I can help you.}
{4010}{}{Nn! Stuff! Me!}
{4020}{}{Dood bye!}
{5000}{}{You want to buy something?}
{5010}{}{Yes!}
{5020}{}{No no no.}
{6000}{}{Hi. I’m Liz. What do you want?}
{6010}{}{I’d like to buy something.}
{6020}{}{What can you tell me about this town?}
{6030}{}{I want to kill something. What’s around?}
{6040}{}{Nothing.}
{7000}{}{It’s a boring little mining town filled with all sorts of undesirables. You want a guided tour, talk to Steve or someone.}
{7010}{}{Wow, a crabby one. I have more questions.}
{7020}{}{Okay. Bye.}
{8000}{}{What is it this time?}
{8010}{}{I want to kill something. What’s around?}
{8020}{}{I’d like to buy something.}
{8030}{}{What can you tell me about this town?}
{8040}{}{Nothing.}
{9000}{}{What’d you have in mind for killing?}
{9010}{}{Radscorpions, rats, that sort of thing.}
{9020}{}{Oh, the occasional humanoid.}
{9030}{}{You. Die, bitch.}
{9040}{}{Bad guys.}
{9050}{}{No one. Forget it.}
{10000}{}{You might try the caves or the area near the homes. I understand there are plenty of monsters there.}
{10010}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{11000}{}{Humanoids, eh? Any humanoids in particular?}
{11010}{}{Humans.}
{11020}{}{Ghouls.}
{11030}{}{Mutants.}
{11040}{}{Just kidding.}
{12000}{}{What’s your definition of a bad guy?}
{12010}{}{Anyone I don’t like. Humanoids, mostly.}
{12020}{}{Anyone who gets in my way.}
{12030}{}{It’s a pretty fluid definition.}
{13000}{}{I don’t support killin’ in this store. Get out.}
{13010}{}{Yeah, whatever. Bitch.}
{14000}{}{Ghouls are useful slaves. They ain’t got enough minds of their own to be people, but they ain’t worth killin’, either. I don’t support the killin’ of ghouls.}
{14010}{}{Fine. I want something else.}
{15000}{}{If you’re really interested in killing mutants, maybe you ought to go out there and put a bullet in the Sheriff's head, instead of standing here talkin'.}
{15010}{}{Fine, maybe I will.}
{16000}{}{Oh, god… another addle-headed mutant baby. When will someone just shoot these things?@@Got-damn mutants. Get the heck outta my store!@@Get the hell outta here!}
