{11010}{}{Take it... [You give him 1000 caps.]}
{11020}{}{I've changed my mind. I'll guess it's better for everyone to bury your dead corpse in the hot desert sand!}

{16050}{}{Did you ever heard of a group called "Enclave"? They will get in, guns blazing, ripping you and your friends into pieces.}
{16060}{}{The New Khans will put your head and the heads of everyone in your group on a pole and use it as a deterrent to others not to fuck with anyone of them.}
{16070}{}{Actually, I don't think this is a good idea now. Maybe guys you want some money instead?}
{16080}{}{Actually, I don't think this is a good idea now. Maybe guys you want some money instead?}
{17000}{}{You're making fun of me, don't you? Brothers, get 'em all down!}
{18000}{}{[He is silent for a moment, then seems to be thinking.] ... Hey... You know... Maybe you are right. We shouldn't overreact here, shouldn't we? Me and my brothers, we have other more imporant things to do now anyway. So... [He notes back to his pals.]}
{18010}{}{Bye and fuck off. *DEV NOTE: NPCS RUN AWAY NOW*}

{19000}{}{Fine! Fine! Fine! [He notes back to his pals, then looks back to you.] ... Adios, punk! You saved your groups life, good work! *DEV NOTE: NPCS RUN AWAY NOW*}
{20000}{}{You saved your life, punk!}
{21000}{}{What? What now? ... [He seems to be scared now.]}
{21010}{}{How about *you* paying *us* some money now? *FAIL* *DEV NOTE: NPCS RUN AWAY NOW*}
{21020}{}{How about *you* paying *us* some money now?}
{22000}{}{We don't have any money! Fuck off! [He runs away.]}
{23000}{}{Fine, fine, fine... Don't shit on me, punk, don't shit on me! [He grabs a small bag on his belt.] ... Here, take this. It's all I have. [A bag with 1000 caps is being thrown into your hands.]}
{23010}{}{See you, someday...}
{24000}{}{Who do you think I am, that I care about what scum you know? }
