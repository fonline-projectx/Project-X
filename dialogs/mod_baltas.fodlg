{2000}{}{Hello, my name's Balthas. I run the Tannery here in Modoc. Can I help you?}
{2010}{}{I'd like to see your wares.}
{2020}{}{Tannery, huh? Say, can you make jackets and armors from the brahmin hide? I'm quite eager to learn how to do it properly.}
{2030}{}{Could you teach me something more about armors?}
{2040}{}{How's business, Balthas?}
{2050}{}{How's business, Balthas? Still having the same problems?}
{2060}{}{Just looking, thanks.}
{3000}{}{Get out of here, idiot.@@Been out in the sun too long?@@Shoo!}
{4000}{}{I killed brahmin better looking than you.@@What.. what are you?@@Please, you're scaring my son.@@I'm going to have to ask you to leave. You're hurting my business.}
{5000}{}{Oh you know. It's been pretty slow, recently. I mean, the custom's here, but it's hard keeping up with demand. Grisham's never got enough hides to spare for me.}
{5010}{}{You know, I don't really have a day job. I could look in to this for you.}
{5020}{}{That sucks, man. I mean, I don't even have a job. Life is tough alright. Later.}
{6000}{}{You would? I mean I'd do it myself but if I leave the shop for a minute some damn wastelander will try stealing what I've got here. Just check in with Grisham and see what's up.}
{6010}{}{I'll go talk to Grisham for you Balthas and see what's up with the brahmin.}
{6020}{}{Not interested, I've got better things to do.}
{7000}{}{Same as ever. This is turning out to be a real chronic issue. Haven't got a decent excuse out of Grisham yet. He's always blaming wastelanders. If you could give it another shot I'd appreciate it.}
{7010}{}{I'll go talk to Grisham for you, Balthas, and see what's up with the brahmin.}
{7020}{}{I hope you find someone else to whine on Grisham.}
{8000}{}{Hey wastelander. I need to thank you.}
{8010}{}{Oh, you already heard?}
{9000}{}{Yeah, Ed's buckaroo's got here a bit before you did and told me about it. Don't know how you got brahmin off that man, but I'm glad for the extra hides. }
{9010}{}{Well, I'm glad to help out.}
{10000}{}{Say, now that I've got a bit more material to work with, I think I can spare an old jacket for you, since I can't really offer you much else.}
{10010}{}{Thanks man, really. I appreciate your candour.}
{11000}{}{Of course I can, that's exactly what I do to earn a living. [Looking carefully at you] Hmmm, interested in expanding your skills, eh? OK, you look like you know some of the basics already... I can show you some tips, but it'll cost you fifteen hundred caps.}
{11010}{}{Fifteen hundred caps? Here, it better be worth it!}
{11020}{}{Sorry, that's too much for me. I might be back later, though.}
{12000}{}{Well, I think there is something I could show you... For three grand.}
{12010}{}{I just happen to have $3000 ready for you... [You give him the money] Let's get to it.}
{12020}{}{Sorry, that's too much for me. I might be back later, though.}
{13000}{}{Good, now pay attention... [Baltas shows you how to make armors and take care of them]}
{13010}{}{Thanks Baltas, I'll do my best to put this knowledge to good use.}
{14000}{}{Good, now pay attention... [Baltas shows you the essence of his skill]}
{14010}{}{Thanks Baltas, I'll do my best to put this knowledge to good use.}
