{100}{}{Harold}
{110}{}{avatar_harold.png}
{200}{}{You see a particularly leathery-looking Ghoul.}
{200}{}{You see Harold.}
{210}{}{You see a very old but still spry-looking ghoul.}
{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{Idiot}
{1020}{}{Unknown}
{1030}{}{Known}
{2000}{}{I gotta tell ya, ol' Harold's a bit slow on the draw hisself. The two of us talkin' wouldn't get a whole lot done.@@Ahh, ain't you cute.  I just don't have time to try understanding ya right now.@@Heh heh, ain't you a kick.}
{3000}{}{Hello there, smoothskin. The name's Harold. I help keep this town running.}
{3010}{}{Smoothskin? Why did you call me that?}
{3020}{}{Hello, Harold. What do you do here?}
{3030}{}{Is there someplace I can barter or re-supply here?}
{3040}{}{Is that a tree growing out of your head?}
{3050}{}{Harold, I'd like to know where I can get some healing.}
{3060}{}{Hello, Harold. Just passing through. Goodbye.}
{4000}{}{Whatcha need, youngster?}
{4010}{}{Why does everyone around here call me smoothskin?}
{4020}{}{Is there someplace I can barter or re-supply here?}
{4030}{}{Is that a tree growing out of your head?}
{4040}{}{Harold, I'd like to know where I can get some healing.}
{4050}{}{Hello, Harold. What do you do here?}
{4060}{}{How about we talk about what you need? No offence, but your ghoul types aren't so good at keeping this place safe.}
{4070}{}{Tell me, can you spare us some of your supplies?}
{4080}{}{We need some volunteers to secure the town.}
{4090}{}{I want to talk about our allies.}
{4100}{}{Let's discuss the law a little.}
{4110}{}{Just passing through. Goodbye.}
{5000}{}{Wha-whatever it takes to keep this place together. Better job on it than me.}
{5010}{}{This place is coming apart?}
{5020}{}{You don't sound so good.}
{6000}{}{Yep, but I'm doing great for being dead! I never get tired of the looks when I tell that one.}
{6010}{}{Ahh, right....So you say the place is falling apart?}
{6020}{}{Dead, you say? Well, in that case you're doing great. So good you can answer my next question.}
{7000}{}{Well, sorta. Our atomic reactor's a mite...sensitive. The people I got running it mean well, but... well, they are not the sharpest tools in the shed. If you know what I mean.}
{7010}{}{What do you mean?}
{7020}{}{Well, I'd love to stay and chat with you but I've got things to do and places to go. Good luck.}
{8000}{}{Need a little time on the whetstone yourself, huh? I mean they are not too bright. Here's an example. The other day I get a report. On it, it says the main coolant valve should be shut down. That woulda caused a meltdown that would make the Grand Canyon look like a pig wallow.}
{8010}{}{That sounds bad.}
{9000}{}{Uh, yeah, that would be bad. Now, I got things fixed up in time, but we came close to the end there. They need someone to watch out for 'em.}
{9010}{}{Good thing you're here to help them.}
{10000}{}{Who'd a thought I'd be making things right?  Although if we don't get this plant working better quick, there is gonna be trouble.}
{10010}{}{Hmm, sounds like a real problem all right. Let me ask you something else.}
{10020}{}{Trouble? What kind of trouble?}
{10030}{}{Well, I've taken enough of your valuable time. Goodbye.}
{11000}{}{You cut with the dull edge of the knife, don't ya?  You don't look like an orange peel left in the sun all day. Your skin's still soft and purty.}
{11010}{}{Got me there. I'll try to make my next question a little more worthwhile.}
{11020}{}{You just better not be getting any funny ideas about my soft skin.}
{11030}{}{Uh, well, I better be going. Goodbye.}
{12000}{}{Funny ideas? Well, you mean like skinning you alive with a rusty, dull, old knife and then grafting your still-warm, wet, glistening, oh-so-soft, skin over my crusty-rotten gook?}
{12010}{}{Hey! You just keep the hell away from me. I'm getting out of here while I still have my skin!}
{12020}{}{Yeah, that's exactly what I meant. Good call.}
{13000}{}{More skin! ... Need more skin! (chuckles) What happ'n? Drop your sense of humor in the dust on the way into town?}
{13010}{}{How 'bout I change the subject with another question?}
{13020}{}{Well, you just better keep your grubby mitts off my skin. Goodbye.}
{14000}{}{Well, you might try talking to Wooz over in the Harp. You can't miss it - it's just across the way.}
{14010}{}{Thanks. Let me ask you something else.}
{14020}{}{That's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}
{15000}{}{Jealous? His name's Herbert. I talk to him when I get lonely... Heh heh. Just kiddin'... His name's Bob.}
{15010}{}{Right...Well, maybe you or Bob will know the answer to this.}
{15020}{}{Thanks, that's way more than I need to know for now. Goodbye.}
{16000}{}{Just talk to my assistant, Lenny. He'll be able to fix ya right up.}
{16010}{}{Thanks. Let me ask you something else.}
{16020}{}{Thanks, that's all I need to know for now. Goodbye.}
{17000}{}{We're leaking radioactive coolant into the groundwater. Now that means, anyone using that water is not gunna need a night-light to take a midnight piss. Also, we need more fuel because our power plant is not burnin' it very efficiently.}
{17010}{}{What happens if you don't fix the plant?}
{17020}{}{Who do you buy your fuel from?}
{17030}{}{Sorry to hear it. Let me ask you about something else.}
{17040}{}{I think I'm going to have to leave you to your troubles for right now. Goodbye.}
{18000}{}{If we don't, you can bet those boneheads from Vault City will shut down our power plant, permanently.}
{18010}{}{What will you do then?}
{19000}{}{We get our fuel from the Broken Hills. That's a mining community some ways south.}
{19010}{}{What happens if you don't fix the plant?}
{19020}{}{Hmm, I think I should let you figure this out on your own. Goodbye.}
{20000}{}{Take dirt naps. Vault City doesn't play nice. They'll just come up here and kill all of us if we don't get things running smooth. Well, at least I'll have a tree for a monument.}
{20010}{}{Sounds like you need to fix the plant pretty badly. Let me ask you something else right now, though.}
{20020}{}{Sounds like trouble. I need to run off and see what I can do. Bye.}
{21000}{}{This is not a problem, there's plenty of people ready to join the militia, but you'll have to pay for the equipments and training. This costs about @lex cost@ caps.}
{21010}{}{Sounds good, here's @lex cost@ caps.}
{21020}{}{Nah, I think we're doing fine as it is now.}
{22000}{}{So, what about friendly factions? Do you want me to make sure the militia looks after a certain faction?}
{22010}{}{Show me the friendly factions.}
{22020}{}{I want to remove a faction from the list.}
{22030}{}{I want to add a new faction to the list.}
{23000}{}{@lex faction@}
{23010}{}{Next}
{23020}{}{Previous}
{23030}{}{Ok, looks good.}
{24000}{}{And what might their name be?}
{24010}{}{Ok, that's all I wanted.}
{25000}{}{Heh heh. They're all heart.}
{25010}{}{So how about me and @lex faction@ help you keep the bad guys out of Gecko?}
{26000}{}{Thanks for the offer, youngster, but I think our problems are a bit too big for you and...@lex faction@, was it? Maybe when you're a little bigger.}
{26010}{}{Okay.}
{26020}{}{You of all people should know appearances don't mean everything, Harold. One man's enough to make some real changes if he's the right man. And in @lex faction@, we're all the right man.}
{27000}{}{Well I see you, but what about @lex faction@? Bring your friends down so I know you're serious about helping us folk.}
{27010}{}{Okay.}
{27020}{}{Wouldn't want to crowd your town with my heavies, Harold. I just brought enough people to keep Gecko safe without having them getting drunk and busting up The Harp.}
{28000}{}{Well it sounds like your heart's in the right place, youngster. But I'm still gonna have to ask that you come back with a bigger gang. If I don't look out for all the ghouls here, well let's just say they ain't so good at doing that by themselves. I can't afford to make mistakes, or we'll all be taking dirtnaps, me included.}
{28010}{}{I see,  Harold. Goodbye, then.}
{29000}{}{Thanks for trying to help us out, stranger. Do us a good turn and we'll do you one right back.}
{29010}{}{Thanks, Harold.}
{30000}{}{Heh! You boys have a good attitude, I'll give you that. Hell, I'll give you a chance to help us out too.  Do right for these ghouls, and we'll do right by you.}
{30010}{}{Thanks, Harold.}
{31000}{}{In the locker, boy. Make a good use of it.}
{31010}{}{Sure, thanks.}
{32000}{}{Here's the current laws in Gecko:
Stealing is prosecuted: @lex stealing@
Carrying weapons openly is illegal: @lex weapons@
Attacking criminals on sight: @lex attackflagged@}
{32010}{}{I want it to be legal to carry weapons openly.}
{32020}{}{I want it to be illegal to carry weapons openly.}
{32030}{}{I've seen enough thieves by now, let's punish every last one of them!}
{32040}{}{I don't think guards should look for thieves, we have higher priorities...}
{32050}{}{I want every last criminal dead, don't let them enter our city under any circumstances!}
{32060}{}{I don't think we have time to go after every little petty criminal, let's relax the laws a bit regarding this...}
{32070}{}{Ok, looks good.}
{33000}{}{Alright, there you go.}
{33010}{}{Right.}
{34000}{}{I'm afraid there's no more volunteers, come back later and check again.}
{34010}{}{Ok.}
{35000}{}{Like I said, training and equipment isn't free. Come back when you have the caps.}
{35010}{}{Yeah, yeah...}
{36000}{}{Error. Report this.}
{37000}{}{Are you crazy? We are in the middle of an ongoing attack, start protecting us instead of jerking around in here!}
{37010}{}{Uh, sure!}
{38000}{}{Guards, get those retards!}
