{2000}{}{What can I do for you?@@Hmm?@@You needed something?}
{2010}{}{That water pump behind your shack looks very rundown.}
{2020}{}{About your water pump...}
{2030}{}{See you.}
{3000}{}{This old machine? It doesn't work already since years. My predecessor wanted a special water pump for the underground farm. It worked a long time but well. Over the time it stopped to work and that's where it is now.}
{3010}{}{I could try to fix the machine.}
{3020}{}{I am a bit skilled in repairing machines. This one doesn't look very hard, if you don't mind, I would take a look at it.}
{3030}{}{That's bad. See you later.}
{4000}{}{[He looks at you for a few seconds.] To me you don't look like this is something for you. }
{4010}{}{Oh well. See you then.}
{4020}{}{I could try it anyway. Would you mind?}
{5000}{}{Sure, why not. It's broken since a long time, so... check it out, if you like.}
{5010}{}{Thanks.}
{6000}{}{Yes, what's the status?}
{6010}{}{I fixed it.}
{6020}{}{Sorry, I can't fix the water pump.}
{6030}{}{I am still working on it.}
{7000}{}{Really? That... that is great news! Thank you very much, it is helping us a lot. Here, take this as your reward. [He gives you some anti radiation medicine.]}
{7010}{}{You know, it was really hard to work to fix the machine. I think it wouldn't hurt, if I could get a bit more for it.}
{7020}{}{You know, it was really hard to work to fix the machine. I think it wouldn't hurt, if I could get a bit more for it.}
{7030}{}{Thank you very much. See you later.}
{8000}{}{What? You are a mean bastard, do you know this? But okay... Here, take my 50 caps and now go away.}
{8010}{}{Thanks.}
{8020}{}{Okay, leave it. I am fine with what I got.}
{9000}{}{Forget it. That's all I can give you. }
{9010}{}{Okay...}
{10000}{}{Thank you. And... thank you again for fixing the machine.}
{10010}{}{No problem.}
{11000}{}{Oh well, that's what I thought. Thank you anyway.}
{11010}{}{See you.}
{100000001}{}{What the hell are you doing?}
{100000001}{}{The well isn't broken. Please repair the water pump.}
{100000001}{}{The water pump is right behind my shack, in case you forgot it.}
{100000001}{}{Are you blind? It's not the water pump!}
