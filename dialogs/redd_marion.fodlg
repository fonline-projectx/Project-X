{100}{}{Sheriff}
{200}{}{You see a strong black man.}
{210}{}{You see Earl Marion, Redding Sheriff.}
{210}{}{You see a powerfully built man looking at you intently.}
{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{info}
{1020}{}{default}
{1030}{}{Idiot}
{1040}{}{New}
{2000}{}{What can Sheriff Marion do for you?}
{2010}{}{I want to place a bounty on someone's head. Think you can set me up? *DEV NOTE: Deactivated for now*}
{2020}{}{What bounties are currently on offer? *DEV NOTE: Deactivated for now*}
{2030}{}{I'm here to claim a bounty, Sheriff. *DEV NOTE: Deactivated for now*}
{2040}{}{What's going on in town, Sheriff?}
{2050}{}{What do you do as Sheriff?}
{2060}{}{How about give me and my team an honest job? Hard to make a straight living in the wastes.}
{2070}{}{How about the promised booze and smokes?}
{2080}{}{I won't make any trouble. I was just leaving. Goodbye.}
{2090}{}{We need some volunteers to secure the town.}
{2100}{}{I want to talk about our allies.}
{2110}{}{Let's discuss the law a little.}
{3000}{}{Hi there, I've got some good news for you. The bounty you set on @lex bountee@ was claimed by @lex hunter@. Poor bastard is six feet under by now. Or less, bounty hunters don't dig deep graves.}
{3010}{}{Glad they got what was coming to them. I've got a few other questions.}
{3020}{}{Great, I gotta go}
{4000}{}{You bet we can. Who's the poor corpse-to-be?}
{4010}{}{[continue]}
{4020}{}{[Leave] I've changed my mind}
{5000}{}{And how much are you willing to pay to put this person in the ground?}
{5010}{}{$1,000.}
{5020}{}{$5,000.}
{5030}{}{$10,000.}
{5040}{}{Nevermind.}
{6000}{}{Okay, just hand me the cash, and... (he fills out some forms). Yep, that's all set up. Check back later, I'll tell you if someone's claimed it by then.}
{6010}{}{Farewell.}
{7000}{}{There's $@lex bounty@ for @lex player@.}
{7010}{}{More}
{7020}{}{Leave}
{8000}{}{Sorry pal, there aren't any bounties set now.}
{8010}{}{Dang.}
{9000}{}{Good work, you're a natural. Here's the cash.}
{9010}{}{It was a pleasure.}
{10000}{}{Sorry, there's no bounty for 'em. I can't pay you. Maybe someone already claimed it.}
{10010}{}{Argh!}
{11000}{}{Where do you think? New Reno. They keep this town awash with booze and chems If you want to know more, just ask the caravan drivers.}
{11010}{}{The Mordinos are responsible for most of Redding's Jet?}
{11020}{}{What a dang shame. I've got some other questions.}
{12000}{}{You're about a taco short of a combination plate.@@No hand-outs here. Now git!@@Move along, little doggy.@@Move along.}
{13000}{}{Howdy there. My name's Earl Marion. I'm the Sheriff in these here parts. Sounds downright picturesque, don't it? Well, that's my job.}
{13010}{}{As the Sheriff, what do you do here in town?}
{13020}{}{I just had a couple questions, Sheriff.}
{13030}{}{I won't make any trouble. I was just leaving. Goodbye.}
{14000}{}{Keep the peace, mostly. Stop them miners for tearing each other's damn heads off, keep folks from hassling Doc Johnson for their daily jet, and rally a defense when them raiders get greedy.}
{14010}{}{Who's Doc Johnson?}
{14020}{}{Sounds like tough work. I've got a couple questions, though.}
{15000}{}{Good ole Painless Doc Johnson's our town doc. You have a toothache or a broken bone, he'll set you to right. He also sells medicine. All kinds of medicine, if you get my drift. For *whatever* ails ya.}
{15010}{}{Sounds like a helpful guy to have around. Where is he here in town?}
{15020}{}{Interesting. Let me ask you something else, Sheriff Marion.}
{15030}{}{Thanks. I'll see you around. Goodbye.}
{15040}{}{Where does this town's jet come from, anyway?}
{16000}{}{The Doc's office is at the west end of downtown here. He's just about always happy to see new patients.}
{16010}{}{I see. Let me ask you something else.}
{16020}{}{Maybe I'll go visit with him for a while. Goodbye, Sheriff.}
{17000}{}{Well we're getting all kinds of external pressures, as always. Keeps a man up at night, worrying about Redding's future.}
{17010}{}{Redding's future? What do you mean?}
{18000}{}{Sure. Redding can't stand alone forever. At some point we're going to need a friend. I just want to make sure we've got a friend when we need one. The *right* friend.}
{18010}{}{There are wrong friends?}
{19000}{}{You bet there are. New Reno would just gut Redding for our gold, and Vault City would keep us as second class citizens rather than make us real partners.}
{19010}{}{You think the NCR would be different?}
{20000}{}{I know it would be. The NCR is the future of the wastes. Working together for a bigger tomorrow. Just like their posters say. They want us to join them, not submit to them.}
{20010}{}{I see. How can you influence Redding, though?}
{20020}{}{Everyone's got an angle, all right. Goodbye, Sheriff.}
{21000}{}{Well, the time's not right yet for a real move. But I let people know who they'll be able to count on when push comes to shove. That's enoughï¿½for now.}
{21010}{}{Interesting. Let me ask you something else.}
{21020}{}{Hmm, something to think about, anyhow. Goodbye.}
{22000}{}{This is not a problem, there's plenty of people ready to join the militia, but you'll have to pay for the equipments and training. This costs about @lex cost@ caps.}
{22010}{}{Sounds good, here's @lex cost@ caps.}
{22020}{}{Nah, I think we're doing fine as it is now.}
{23000}{}{So, what about friendly factions? Do you want me to make sure the militia looks after a certain faction?}
{23010}{}{Show me the friendly factions.}
{23020}{}{I want to remove a faction from the list.}
{23030}{}{I want to add a new faction to the list.}
{24000}{}{@lex faction@}
{24010}{}{Next}
{24020}{}{Previous}
{24030}{}{Ok, looks good.}
{25000}{}{And what might their name be?}
{25010}{}{Ok, that's all I wanted.}
{26000}{}{Yeah, they got themselves whole teams of science types to whip up batches of jet ever since that kid working for 'em up and disappeared. You'd have to be stupid to give up such a sweet gig.}
{26010}{}{Pretty stupid. I got a couple questions.}
{26020}{}{Maybe they can use someone with my expertise... uh, bye Sheriff.}
{26030}{}{I guess those science guys are useful for something. Bye Sheriff.}
{27000}{}{I can sympathise, but we've got big problems here in Redding, and we'd need a bigger team than yours to help us handle them.}
{27010}{}{I see.}
{27020}{}{I don't see your team any place, Marion. But you're enough to be in charge around here on your own, right? Well so am I! We're not your regular chumps with guns, we're the elite models.}
{28000}{}{Hmmm..[scratches chin.] There might be something. Go round up all your boys so I can get a good look at you.}
{28010}{}{Alright, I'll come back with more of my gang.}
{28020}{}{This is all you need right here. Take a good look. Don't you see the essence of pure bad-assery dripping from our perfect forms?}
{29000}{}{[A deep, sincere and unplanned frown spreads across Marion's face.] Look...no.  Just no. I think you got the wrong idea about this job, son.}
{29010}{}{Right. Sorry.}
{29020}{}{You're not my dad, dickhead. If you were, I wouldn't be about to kill you.}
{30000}{}{You bet. Well, I'm proud that you want to do some good out here, so I can give you work: help me uphold the law here in Redding, and I'll help you stay in booze and smokes. No fighting, no shooting, no killing, and no cussing. Alright?}
{30010}{}{You've got yourself a deal, Marion.}
{30020}{}{No cussing? Fuck that! I'm outta here.}
{31000}{}{[Breathes in slowly, thinking what you said over and studying you.] Alright, you got yourself a deal: help me uphold the law here in Redding, and I'll help you stay in booze and smokes. No fighting, no shooting, no killing, and no cussing. Alright?}
{31010}{}{You've got yourself a deal, Marion.}
{31020}{}{No cussing? Fuck that! I'm outta here.}
{32000}{}{Visit the nearby room and check the locker there.}
{32010}{}{I will, Sheriff.}
{33000}{}{Here's the current laws in Redding:
Stealing is prosecuted: @lex stealing@
Carrying weapons openly is illegal: @lex weapons@
Attacking criminals on sight: @lex attackflagged@}
{33010}{}{I want it to be legal to carry weapons openly.}
{33020}{}{I want it to be illegal to carry weapons openly.}
{33030}{}{I've seen enough thieves by now, let's punish every last one of them!}
{33040}{}{I don't think guards should look for thieves, we have higher priorities...}
{33050}{}{I want every last criminal dead, don't let them enter our city under any circumstances!}
{33060}{}{I don't think we have time to go after every little petty criminal, let's relax the laws a bit regarding this...}
{33070}{}{Ok, looks good.}
{34000}{}{Alright, there you go.}
{34010}{}{Right.}
{35000}{}{I'm afraid there's no more volunteers, come back later and check again.}
{35010}{}{Ok.}
{36000}{}{Like I said, training and equipment isn't free. Come back when you have the caps.}
{36010}{}{Yeah, yeah...}
{37000}{}{Error. Report this.}
{38000}{}{Are you crazy? We are in the middle of an ongoing attack, start protecting us instead of jerking around in here!}
{38010}{}{Uh, sure!}
{39000}{}{Guards, get those retards!}
