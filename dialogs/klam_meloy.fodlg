{100}{}{Meloy}
{200}{}{You see Meloy, the trapper.}
{210}{}{He looks muddy and unwashed.}
{1000}{}{Predialogue installations}
{1010}{}{Answer text, didnt talked before}
{1020}{}{bereits gesprochen}
{2000}{}{I don't believe we've met again! What can I do for you?}
{2010}{}{A trapper? Man, you stink.}
{2020}{}{I'm just looking around, thanks.}
{2030}{}{I'm just looking around, thanks.}
{2040}{}{About that stranded ship...}
{3000}{}{I don't believe we've met. I'm Meloy. What can I do for you?}
{3010}{}{You are a trapper? Man, you stink.}
{3020}{}{I'm just looking around, thanks.}
{3030}{}{I'm just looking around, thanks.}
{3040}{}{About that stranded ship...}
{4000}{}{I might stink, but that doesn't change the fact of me being smart!}
{4010}{}{Yeah, I see.}
{4020}{}{You look like you have some stories to tell.}
{4030}{}{So, as a trapper, you know some fancy caves?}
{5000}{}{[Looks like he didn't noticed your sarcasm.] Finally someone who acknowledges it!}
{5010}{}{You look like you have some stories to tell.}
{6000}{}{You are really right, that's what I have! But unfortunately, I am not in the mood to tell you now.}
{6010}{}{That's a shame. I am going then...}
{6020}{}{That's a shame. I am going then...}
{7000}{}{Hey, wait a second.}
{7010}{}{What now?}
{8000}{}{Say, you look like some mean bastard. I might have something to do for you... I would do it by myself, but as you maybe can see, I am not in the best condition anymore.}
{8010}{}{You look pretty okay to me.}
{8020}{}{You look pretty okay to me.}
{9000}{}{But I am not!}
{9010}{}{Maybe you are right. What is it that you want me to do?}
{9020}{}{Still no chance. See you.}
{10000}{}{Yes, maybe you are right... But I need your help anyway.}
{10010}{}{If it's so important and dangerous, what is it then?}
{10020}{}{Yeah, that's what I thought. Bye.}
{11000}{}{Me and my friends have been at the coast a short while ago. There we found a big old ship, stranded. Empty as far as we could see. Tried to enter it on the side, was possible because it got a big hole there.}
{11010}{}{And what has this to do with me?}
{12000}{}{It was very dangerous. A lot of locked doors and rats and even armed robots! Too much for us, eh. We left it and that's it. But I want something from there... The ship documents. If you can bring them to me, I will reward you well!}
{12010}{}{Fair deal? Guess that could work. Tell me where it is and I'll get you that documents.}
{12020}{}{Fair deal? Guess that could work. Tell me where it is and I'll get you that documents.}
{12030}{}{I will think about it. See you later.}
{13000}{}{I see you have some backup with you. This should higher your survival chance a 'lil bit. }
{13010}{}{Where is that ship now?}
{14000}{}{Give me your map, I'll show you the location... It's on the west coast, some miles south west from here. [He shows you the position.]}
{14010}{}{Got it. We will come back with your documents.}
{15000}{}{I am waiting.}
{15010}{}{See you.}
{16000}{}{You have anything new to say?}
{16010}{}{I've catched myself some backup. We are ready to go to the stranded ship now.}
{16020}{}{I think, I should train a bit more... see you later.}
{16030}{}{I have what you wanted.}
{16040}{}{Nothing new yet.}
{17000}{}{Very good! [He looks like a happy child.] Here, take the 100 caps and be happy with it!}
{17010}{}{Very well. It was nice to make deals with you.}
{17020}{}{What, just 100 caps? Give me more!}
{17030}{}{What, just 100 caps? That really wasn't an easy task. You could give me some more.}
{18000}{}{I don't have any additional caps. You should be happy with what I could give you!}
{18010}{}{Yeah, whatever...}
{19000}{}{Yeah, I guess you are right. Here, another 100 caps for you. But more I can really not give you.}
{19010}{}{Sounds better. Thanks.}
{20000}{}{Wait, don't you feel a bit too weak? You should train a bit more first, then we can talk again.}
{20010}{}{Okay, I come back later.}
{21000}{}{You mean like the 'ol toxic caves? Nah...}
{21010}{}{What a shame. Anyway, see you later. Maybe. And by the way, you stink.}
{21020}{}{What a shame. Anyway, see you later. Maybe. And by the way, you stink.}
{21030}{}{...Toxic caves? Tell me about it.}
{22000}{}{Did I just say toxic caves? Uh oh... eh... well. Yeah, that's some big hole in the mountain to the north of here. It's not a nice place, but you can find many golden geckos in that area.}
{22010}{}{Maybe I will check it out one day. See you.}
{22020}{}{Maybe I will check it out one day. See you.}
