{200}{}{You see Scully.}
{200}{}{You see Scullion.}
{200}{}{You see Scullion. *Scully".}
{210}{}{You see a career raider.  He was born for this job, and he knows it.}
{210}{}{You see Scullion. Everyone calls him Scully. It's probably because Scullion is a terrible name.}
{210}{}{You see Scully. He's sat on the edge of his bed doing some dumbbell curls.}
{240}{}{You see a dead Scully!}

{3020}{}{What's your position here? You've got better gear than most.}
{4000}{}{Those who can't kill will always be subject to those who can. We've carved ourselves a niche in this world, and it suits me just fine. It's not the easiest life, but what is? We're just the best at what we do, so we do it. That's all there is to it.}
{4010}{}{Makes sense. Can I ask something else?}
{4020}{}{I see. Goodbye.}
{5000}{}{I'm a Lieutenant. Carter's in charge, and then there's me and Garcia and Raynes as his lieutenants. Garcia and me help run stuff here, and Raynes runs that little outpost down south.}
